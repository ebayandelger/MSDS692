<h1>Sentiment Analysis on Reddit's posts about Dogecoin</h1>

<h3>SUMMARY</h3>
Financial experts are highly skeptical of dogecoin, as well as other cryptocurrencies. Their extreme volatility is one reason experts say that crypto is a risky, speculative investment. That's why only the younger generation is investing in dogecoin but I am not sure if they even understand how dogecoin actually works or they care to know. Me and my colleagues had a big debate about dogecoin recently arguing whether itâ€™s a good investment or not. And we couldn't reach an agreement because simply we did not understand how cryptocurrency worked. So, I decided to pick Dogecoin as my project for MSDS 692 Practicum I and learn about it at the same time.
<p> I performed a sentiment analysis on Reddit posts to see if people are posting positive information or negative information. Then, I based my outlook on that descriptive analysis I performed about Dogecoin.

0.046,0.767,0.186,0.9914,"One of the challenges with real world transactions using dogecoin right now is that there is no good way to handle delays in the bank-and-forth that normally happens with a transaction. Take the following example:

Problem 1: Shipping/purchase problem

1. Buyer purchases a new bike from Amazon for $1500
2. Amazon verifies that purchasing power equals $1500 for transaction
3. Amazon cannot actually charge the buyer until the bike ships per legal regulations
4. Amazon goes to ship bike, but its 2am and the person getting it ready isn't privvy to the seller's contact info to complete the transaction (transaction fails?)

Problem 2: Recurring payments/e-Bills

1. Buyer agrees to take possession of a case of cleaning supplies every month or to pay an eBill up to certain limit each month
2. Buyer wants to use crypto
3. Seller wants to charge buyer as agreed using subscription pricing or to pay unspecified amount of an ebill, but buyer is now required to enter the transaction whereas historically using a bank or credit card this would not be the case.

It seems to me that the solution would be to create custodian accounts that allow two parties to transact rapidly, and both parties can verify the state of the transaction. A purchase would put money into the custodian account, but the amount doesn't deposit to the merchant until product is shipped. If certain conditions are not met, the custodian would return the amount to the original owner. For recurring purchases, I guess you would just put in enough to cover multiple months of purchases, like a bank.

Is this where smart contracts come in, or is there another solution already designed for this? I'm curious how others have worked out this problem as entities like Amazon consider payments in crypto."

Just spitballing here. 50c instead of 1c transaction fees as a target for transactions on the extra layer 2 network (same low fees on the main network).

Validators would split fees by staked percentage. Something like how liquidity pooling works, yeah?

That way, the PoS would be optional, keep the mainnet pure PoW, secure, decentralized with no major changes needed. But some of the txn volume would be offloaded onto the settlement.

Would likely also give fast enough txn's for point of sale, and add to scalability. This would also probably give higher APY than conventional proof of stake, making it incentivized better.

* Low energy usage
* Low fees
* Fast transaction speed

AFAIK the main cons are that this architecture hasn't been tested at scale and that at low transaction volume the network can become quite decentralized.

0.076,0.676,0.248,0.9986,"TLDR; Switch to PoS or similar, but keep the 10,000/min reward and distribute it to the public in a variety of fair and fun ways that solidifies Doge‚Äôs status as the ultimate people‚Äôs coin.

....Hear me out....this is for fun and ideas...none of this is an immediate serious suggestion....

My hypothesis is something along the lines of....a long, fair, and widely accessible coin distribution is the most important factor benefitting a crypto currency‚Äôs public adoption. I believe that giving away 10,000 Doge per minute to the public (instead of as block reward) would have tremendous positive impact on the currency‚Äôs value and public adoption, counter to conventional capped supply approaches. 

I like that doge is uncapped. I think maintaining the supply of fresh coin provides a unique opportunity to √ê.O.G.E. and further solidify doge‚Äôs role as the people‚Äôs coin. As it stands today no Doge hodler benefits financially from the block reward anyway. So if consensus and security can (eventually?) be had without a large PoW block reward, how would Doge continue its minting? Traditional staking rewards lead to centralization....instead....what‚Äôs the Shibetobiest thing that could possibly be done with those 10,000 doge per minute? .....**Give the 10,000 coins per minute away for free.** 

This idea hikes it‚Äôs leg and pisses all over the fire hydrant that is hyper-deflationary-moon-coin-rug-pulling.

Here‚Äôs my non-dev, idiot populist vision...y‚Äôall chime in please: 

*Assume doge is low energy, low/0 fee, fast transaction time.... pos, DAG, whatever works and doesn‚Äôt require paying miners. I dunno I‚Äôm an idiot. I just know some cryptos are doing it. 

*Maintain 10,000 doge per minute distributed as follows:

*25% rewarded equally to all Nodes operating at the chain tip or equivalent. 

*25% rewarded to charities which Doge hodlers can delegate to from their wallets. 

*10% public faucet (many low payouts, spam resistant maybe tiny PoW or captcha or something)

*10% geography based faucets (see wenano app) to ensure doge is spread worldwide. Users would be able to claim Doge if they were within a certain physical distance. 

*10% staking reward for doge hodlers

*10% development bounties 

*10% public lottery accessible to anyone who can prove they‚Äôre signed up in good faith (financially meaningful payout size). 

I think this provides several ways to reach more citizens of the world. I think everyone with a smart phone could own some doge, even if they didn‚Äôt have funds or access to buy. I think that kind of adoption would lead to many many positive growth opportunities for doge and, counter-intuitively, would be good for coin value. 

I realize the enormous shitload of work it would be to accomplished, but let‚Äôs ignore that for now and poke holes in the general idea.

Consistent with previous payout rounds, payouts are done in 2 tiers: major and minor, where each tier is defined by the amount and/or importance of code contributions that made it into the releases (i.e. have not been reversed.) 5 contributors had 10 or more contributions and one contribution ([#1676](https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin/pull/1676)) had such an impact (it fixed the performance of the entire Dogecoin network by a factor 20) that it was deemed of enough importance to be awarded a major tier payout.

Contributors that exclusively provided trivial fixes to code comments and documentation have been filtered out, to disincentivize commit spam.

As a result, six major contributors have each received 335,000 DOGE, and nine minor contributors have received 55,000 DOGE each. One payout has been requested to be delayed pending tax advice.

Duration: 
24hr

Goal: 
Observe performance of u/sodogetip (DOGE tip bot) within r/dogecoin.

Procedure: 
-Using the ""+/u/sodogetip 1 doge verify"" command; enable command as a reply as much as possible, as quickly as possible using a dedicated thread.
-Start with 300 DOGE. 
-Record and report all findings.

Results:
-Sucessful command exicution rate peaked at 9 commands per minute.
- Inital command error, ""1doge"" used instead of ""1 doge"". This error was found after ~20 tip attempts, these were deleted and updated avoiding duplication.
- Test required deviation from the control environment due to lack of user activity. Testing was moved to the general sub to interact with more users.
-Rate of successful transaction was dramatically impacted due to the large percentage of unregistered users.
- Found command does not work in chats.
Data:
- ~300 commands executed (rounded down from 312 for error allowance).
- 82 verification notifications.
- Approximate successful tip percentage 27%.
-Typical sucessful command to verification receipt time 40 seconds.

Observations:
-Inital usage instructions were difficult to locate; once found, usage was generally painless. 
-Large amount of users were suspicious of command activity; two users became offended after tipping occurred.
-No errors observed with command execution.
-3 instances of post limitation due to exceeding Reddit's activity limit.¬† 
-Initial deposit posted within a few minutes from source, subsequent deposit was successful after 15<>30 minutes.

Recommendations:
- +Balance command could show both current balance and balance after pending tips.
- Basic ""what is"" and ""how to"" explination on bot profile to make it more user friendly.
- Mention tip bot somewhere visible on sub to raise awareness and lower suspicions.
- Don't allow users to post additional tips that could cause pending tips to fault. (To avoid the awkward.)
- Condition resources to expedite expansion to multiple platforms, this would spread functionality and allow for a rapid increase in coin circulation.

Abstracts:
- The usefulness of the bot exceeds face value, aside from seeing who does/doesn't have an active bot wallet (if you see value in that), the act of posting a command summons the bot whom could then post confirming a successful tip. This could in theory triple the comment activity in the sub if every post/comment/reply was tipped. This, of course, would draw the attention of the entities watching activity.
- Wallets with 1 doge are unable to move said doge (due to the ""on chain"" transaction fee), on a large enough scale this would lower the volatility of DOGE in general. This would also allow the value of this coins to appriciate naturally leaving joy to those who remember it later.
- Although 1 DOGE = 1 DOGE, the acceptance value of 1 DOGE = ~0.273 DOGE based on this experiment. This corrilation was far closer to the market value (in USD) than I had originally anticipated. 

Follow-up hypothesis:
More tipping = Higher value
Given the magnitude of the subject, and the fact that the mods here were totally righteous in not banning me for spamming tips, I will plan to repeat this experiment in the near future to confirm my findings."

There is no wallet for iOS(and I couldn't google why?) so
I started from multidoge wallet from official site.
Launched, got address, transfered coins from exchange to it and never got synced because it is stuck at ""Connecting 0 peers"" which I believe old issue based on github issues and tricks with custom peers setup(which didn't work in my case).

I exported private key and downloaded latest dogecoin-core.
To ""restore wallet"" I had to find debug console, read one-lined help and import key just to receive output ""NULL"" which I don't know is okay or not(and won't know until sync complete).
And now waiting for sync 7 years behind.
This part of the joke is not funny at all guys. I don't know about other users but as a senior backend developer I feel confused about the whole situation. Dogecoin has to be friendly, easy and kind.

tldr
Entry curve for dogecoin operating is disastrous and this is what have to be enhanced first to make doge widely available and user friendly.

The environmental impact of mining cryptocurrencies (and computation in general) is becoming significant.

A way around it could be migrating crypto mining on the moon using nuclear energy and sending the data through. Similarly, other heavy computation could be migrated there.

A business case could be attached to the proposition as this could also apply to other computation needs currently serviced on earth which already has a massive impact, and also act as a ""pilot"" to space colonisation

Why reinvent the wheel and have to compete when you can join forces with a project that has already put in the hard work of solving many of the challenges to being decentralized, inexpensive, scalable and secure?

It is possible to overlook such an option until you see the immediate advantages of this platform and how easy one could port Dogecoin over to another chain. 


Why Cardano?

Cardano utilizes Proof of stake, is scalable and ready to use now.  



Scalability -  Hydra -Set to come online in near future - Up to 1 million transactions per second.

‚ÄúSo with 1000 pools, Cardano could be theoretically able to scale up to 1 million TPS and the finality of transactions will be very fast. ‚Äú

https://cardanians-io.medium.com/hydra-cardano-scalability-solution-36b05ddc91cf




Native Token settlement -

Cardano will allow settlement of transactions using Cardano native tokens.  This could be very useful in minimizing fees and allowing DogeX only pools to exist. 

See ‚ÄòBabel Fee‚Äô

https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/02/25/babel-fees/




Transaction fee minimization- Dynamic transaction fees

Cardano to implement dynamic transaction fees, self-aware of price, at some point in the future. High utilization of the network combined with self aware fee adjustments, will work together to keep transaction fees as low a safely possible, dynamically, at all times. 



This is a solid blockchain that is ready to go now.




Enter - DogeX

asset1w303dxx7eatk9h3nsc9sg6fxqvh99sutwgvp62
Ôøº


To show how this could be done, I‚Äôve gone ahead and minted a Cardano Native Token and named it DogeX


Token stats 

Max supply 200 Billion Hard Capped

Why 2 billion?

Firstly, there are already 129 billion Doge and we want to air drop 1-1 and leave some for future uses.

Secondly, Cardano Native tokens can be broken down into .000001 increments.  

If we imagined .000001 DogeX being worth .01 USD. The total market cap at that point would be equivalent to 2 quadrillion USD.  Would we ever need more than this in our entire solar system? 




Conversion - Port process 

1-1 airdrop to all existing Doge holders with guaranteed token freeze/burn of the original Doge. 


All remaining DogeX tokens after Airdrop to be locked in a smart contract and released at a predefined, potentially fluctuating, (more on this later) rate.  My initial thought would be a release 1 million per day for next 192 years. Something like that. 


All proceeds of remaining DogeX go toward further goals of the project. 





Project goals - Doge to be come the currency of the Sun solar system.

Proceeds from remains 70 Billion could be used in 1 or both of 2 ways.


1.) Subsidized transaction fees  - Remaining DogeX tokens could be used to cover transaction fees likely via a variable inflationary type model. Possibly a zero cost to end user and or merchant model. 

e.g. the number of DogeX released to cover costs would be dynamic and fluctuate dependent on market conditions.

or

2.) Make DogeX interplanetary capable - Use funds to -

Create satellite constellation around the moon - minimum of 3 with each satellite running a Cardano relay node.

Create satellite constellation around Mars. Minimum 3 satellites each running a Cardano relay node.

Saltelite(s) (on earths solar orbit? Ask Elon) needed to allow communication with Mars while Mars is on other side of sun.

My fellow Shibes,

It‚Äôs been a wild ride so far but now our backs are up against the ropes. We‚Äôve had our ups and downs like all of the other crypto communities but, if anything, we‚Äôve proven that we are resilient‚Ä¶ and the potential futures look *so* bright; however, we **are** at a crossroads. We have in front of us the opportunity to come together and blaze a path forward through the challenges facing us as well as the broader crypto community and to represent something more.

Dogecoin related announcements by various organizations seem to be coming out at a faster rate, which is fantastic. The core developers and contributors are doing an amazing job, but there are some intense global pressures and a lot of us are simply looking for ways to contribute to the success of the coin. Unfortunately the barrier of entry in contributing to the Dogecoin core codebase is steep, but I believe that i‚Äôve found the way forward‚Ä¶ a viable pathway to running Dogecoin completely on ***SOLAR POWER***... and it all starts with this:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/b5trfaz6ez671.png?width=462&format=png&auto=webp&s=f26fffd79749244b58f52b4848373c7e233af26a

&#x200B;

The humble Raspberry Pi.

I‚Äôm proposing that we build an appliance based off of it.

&#x200B;

In a [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoindev/comments/nmfejy/alpha_release_dogecoin_on_kubernetes/) I announced the alpha release of a DogecoinD Docker Image and Kubernetes Helm Chart. The tech industry uses Kubernetes (k8s) to operate services in the cloud and is increasingly becoming the de facto standard upon which to develop and deploy your applications. When I started looking for ways to contribute I started with the simplest question: How do I run Dogecoin and work on it? The Dogecoin Core codebase ultimately gets compiled down into a single executable file that can run on your machine, but you have to run the file that maps to the type of machine you‚Äôre using. If you look in the ‚ÄúAssets‚Äù section of the [latest Dogecoin release](https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin/releases/tag/v1.14.3) you‚Äôll see that it‚Äôs available for a variety of platforms. I would venture to say that most people interact with the Dogecoin Core Wallet with the GUI interface on either Windows or OSX because it‚Äôs simple to use and we haven‚Äôt really had a need for something more complicated. Until now.

Admittedly, k8s is typically synonymous with large enterprises that run very complex workloads and historically it‚Äôs notorious for being a beast to set up, but the ecosystem of tooling these days has made it relatively simple to get started. Just keep in mind that Kubernetes is simply a way to package up software like Dogecoin to make it portable across systems and to help automate its lifecycle. It‚Äôs an orchestrator to be specific. So I decided to demonstrate how easy it can be by turning a Raspberry Pi into a Kubernetes powered Dogecoin FullNode. Thankfully, the devs have already been producing an aarch64 build, so I did a bunch of work and today i‚Äôm proud to announce **multi-arch support in the Dogecoin Docker image**. The \`aitherarchitect/dogecoin:latest\` image now supports both x86\_64 as well as aarch64/armv8 ***simultaneously*** and the entire initial setup from a fresh Raspebrry Pi has been boiled down to:

1. Flash MicroSD card with 64-bit version of Raspberry Pi OS for arm64/armv8/aarch64 (Official, but still a pre-release) - [http://downloads.raspberrypi.org/raspios\_arm64/images/raspios\_arm64-2021-05-28/2021-05-07-raspios-buster-arm64.zip](http://downloads.raspberrypi.org/raspios_arm64/images/raspios_arm64-2021-05-28/2021-05-07-raspios-buster-arm64.zip)[http://downloads.raspberrypi.org/raspios\_arm64/images/](http://downloads.raspberrypi.org/raspios_arm64/images/)
2. Immediately change default user‚Äôs pw and set up new user with sudo
3. Apt-get update && apt-get install -y git && Apt-get upgrade
4. Start SSH and set to start on boot (raspi-config cli tool > Interfaces submenu); Switch from console over to a remote SSH connection as desired
5. Enable container features: \`cgroup\_enable=cpuset cgroup\_memory=1 cgroup\_enable=memory >> /boot/cmdline.txt\`
6. Reboot
7. Install k3s: \`curl -sfL [https://get.k3s.io](https://get.k3s.io) | sh -\`
8. Install helm: \`curl [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helm/helm/master/scripts/get-helm-3](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helm/helm/master/scripts/get-helm-3) | bash\`
9. Configure cli tools to use k3s provided user config:\`export KUBECONFIG=/etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml && echo 'export KUBECONFIG=/etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml' >> \~/.bashrc\`
10. Install arkade simply because it‚Äôs amazing: \`curl -sLS [https://dl.get-arkade.dev](https://dl.get-arkade.dev) | sudo sh\`
11. git clone [https://github.com/Aither-Architect/dogecoin-helm.git](https://github.com/Aither-Architect/dogecoin-helm.git)
12. \`cd dogecoin-helm/; helm install dogecoin .\`

With those commands, your FullNode will start syncing with the network, provided that your local network firewall settings allow the communication.  I shall call it‚Ä¶ the Dogeberry Pi! When I got all of that working I couldn‚Äôt help but get a chuckle from the seeming insanity of packing all of this high tech into what most people regard as a hobby board, but I bought a Raspberry Pi 4 Model B with 8 GiB of RAM; it‚Äôs a respectably beefy little thing that (thanks to the armv8 architecture in the Pi 4‚Äôs) is now capable of training Machine Learning models and neural networks. Looking at the resource usage, a fully synced and idle node consumes approximately \~1GiB of RAM and the cpu is mostly idle:

&#x200B;

So one could very reasonably assume that we generally have about 6 GiB to work with on the side and treat this as both a dual purpose Dogeberry Pi node as well as a home software development server. Personally, i‚Äôve been warming up to the idea of installing [OpenHAB](https://www.openhab.org/) on it to tie all of my smarthome devices together. All of this capability in such a small device that can be powered on \~10  watts under load is pretty amazing.

To put this into perspective even *further*, that‚Äôs approximately 10 [Hamster-Power](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/383iqq/how_much_power_could_be_generated_from_hamster/)

It‚Äôs such a minimal amount of power that one could so very easily‚Ä¶ yep you guessed it:

run this thing completely off of solar power! Yes, that Dogeberry Pi is completely off-grid save for the WiFi that it‚Äôs consuming. The PiJuice HAT made it so easy to set this up, you just plug the thing in and go for the most part. The solar panel array I bought is honestly way overkill for this Proof of Concept, as they‚Äôre rated at 100 Watts. I went oversized because I live in Austin, TX and ERCOT isn‚Äôt exactly winning any awards lately‚Ä¶

So let me back up a bit‚Ä¶ i‚Äôm running the Dogecoin Core software on a Raspberry Pi 4B, **COMPLETELY POWERED BY THE G-DANG SUN** with power to spare. I call that a win!

Before we go further, I can already hear some of you: ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs cute and all, Sean, but a Raspberry Pi doesn‚Äôt have a shot in hell stacked up against ASIC mining rigs‚Äù. Yes, that‚Äôs true‚Ä¶ well sort of  ;) Let‚Äôs unpack that a bit.

For any given computer running Dogecoin, it‚Äôs doing two things:

1. Securing the network by validating and propagating transactions
2. Mining

With a Proof of Work model, the Pi has *zero* chances on the mining front when stacked up against GPUS and ASICs, i‚Äôll give you that. The thing is, though, that both functions are necessary and the beautiful part is that every solar powered Dogeberry Pi out there can be treated as a sort of carbon offset when considering the Dogecoin network as a whole and towards that goal of ‚Äúusing less than 1% the energy of Bitcoin‚Äù.

When it comes to mining from the Dogeberry Pi, we have well.. work.. to do. Proof of Work and Proof of Stake have gotten us this far so we can‚Äôt knock on them too hard but their shortcomings are painfully clear for where we are in our global crypto journey. The dynamics of centralization of wealth in both systems leaves something to be desired and locks the common people out. The barrier of entry into Proof of Stake IS existing wealth, so that means there‚Äôs almost no hope for someone starting from scratch. Now on to Proof of Work and the electricity consumption‚Ä¶ here we go. We are using so much electricity because of the sheer amount of computation being done (to get the duh, no-brainer out of the way), but what is that computation actually doing? Taking a look further, we are more or less just exploring a solution space by randomly guessing. In other words, when you‚Äôre trying to mine for rewards what you‚Äôre actually doing is playing a fancy-pants version of Battleship where you‚Äôre trying to hit a target by process of elimination. You‚Äôre playing against a computer opponent and everyone else is playing against their own. Whoever beats their opponent first, wins. Now what if you started playing the game at 10x the speed of all of the other humans playing? This is why people invest in ASIC rigs for mining, to simply play the game *faster.* But to what end? Sure, somebody gets a reward, but the game/computation itself is otherwise useless and everyone else simply wasted electricity in the attempt. If we‚Äôre going to use up computation (and thus electricity), its use should be maximized or at the very least *useful*. Enter the aptly named system, Proof of Useful Work:

[https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.09244v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.09244v1)

&#x200B;

This gem of a paper as an alternative to the traditional Proof of Work was brought to my attention by u/Odysseus2202. I have to admit that at first I brushed it off because I didn‚Äôt know too much about the nuts and bolts of the proof systems in crypto at the time but I really don‚Äôt like dismissing things out of hand. So I sat down over the course of several nights to study, consumed the topics as best I could to get oriented with the landscape as well as some of the nuance, and made a concerted effort to understand what the paper was suggesting. I‚Äôm so glad that I did because the ideas presented shook my soul. It offers something groundbreaking and revolutionary for crypto yet the premise is so simple:

If the river is flowing -anyway- let‚Äôs put a water wheel on it to put that energy to work.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/c2wqfbiogz671.jpg?width=612&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3b3d8cb87b8a8b530a8f23b5611cbd522ac77b1c

This brings about a system that promotes: **Honest Pay for Honest Work**

Organizations and individual experimenters require huge amounts of computing power to train Machine Learning models and Neural Nets and they pay HEFTY sums to get it. The Dogecoin network is one big global pool of compute power. Let‚Äôs sell that compute power to organizations and the reward for doing honest, useful work is some Dogecoin. We would need to expose an API and customer/utility portal of some sort, but that‚Äôs a road well trodden. This idea of crowd-sourced distributed compute pools is nothing new as there is precedence with the SETI program, Folding@Home, NiceHash, etc. In this model, **EVERYONE** that participates in a batch of useful work would get a Dogecoin payout proportional to the amount of computing power offered to the compute job.

Before I got too excited I wanted to run this paper by some friends in Data Science to get their thoughts on the viability of this paradigm. I reached out to Rob Chong and Deepak Shah, a Director of Data Science and a Principal Data Scientist, respectively. While they did raise some questions related to the finer points of data flows while training models (I kind of went cross-eyed at this part of the phone conversation, I can‚Äôt lie), they each gave a thumbs up on calling it a viable pathway. Let‚Äôs debate the merits of this paper together.

A supremely critical point to bring up is that this model could potentially invalidate the usage of ASICs ***altogether*** due to the nature of the work at the macro scale being very general and unknown in advance. This levels the playing field for the common folk.

Switching to Proof of Useful Work means that the Dogeberry Pi appliance could then legitimately become an entry-level mining rig and thus becomes a passive source of income by selling computing power to organizations; the operator/maintainer of the Dogeberry Pi appliance then only needs to worry about keeping the rig online and in good working order to earn a passive income. The payout price would be comprised of numerous factors like the availability of compute pools with respect to demand, the capability of the underlying hardware offered, the current price of Dogecoin at the time, etc. Since the compute power would be crowd-sourced and (ideally) solar, I think it could be reasonable to target a cost of compute that is 50% of the cost of major cloud compute like AWS. Keeping the price point a proportion of cloud compute costs incentivizes organizations to prefer the Dogecoin Compute Network over others. The economics of this should work out such that it‚Äôs feasible to run this with a single Dogeberry Pi node and earn an income, or go all in on a massive solar compute farm as a business. Ultimately what I would love to see is that we make running a FullNode profitable enough that someone from an affluent country would want to do it. If we can do that, then the possibility exists to raise entire families out of poverty in the less affluent countries (of course assuming training volume). The barrier of entry into a new socioeconomic bracket then becomes

* Raspberry Pi
* Power Management Module w/ Battery
* Solar Panel
* Internet connection and bandwidth
* The willpower to learn and the commitment to stick to it

There are some tradeoffs, of course. Yes, the training process for ML models would be slower than GPU based clusters that are not based on this federated model of training. It‚Äôs not meant to be a Model S Plaid; it‚Äôs more like the commuter train. It‚Äôs about Economy vs. Performance. Each individual unit isn‚Äôt a screaming machine, but if we have thousands of them acting in unison, then we have something formidable. This paradigm brings several layers of utility to Dogecoin, creates a forcing function towards adoption, and creates transaction volume. Building this fleet of Dogeberry Pi‚Äôs could be the first major step toward a more harmonious future for crypto.

**A note here for a follow up post**: Building this out means that there will be more levers in the codebase to pull that can have serious economic consequences. We should look into implementing a governance token to start a DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) for voting rights over key decisions. Governance tokens could be earned by staking coins to a Liquidity Pool (thus paving the way for some advanced DeFi applications) and earning/farming an intermediary utility token. The intermediary token could be farmed and used to buy more Dogecoin or it could be minted into the governance/voting token (non-transferrable).

**Market opportunities people could use to generate income from a Dogeberry Pi world:**

* Dogecoin branded and custom 3D printed Raspberry Pi cases -- The picture of my solar Dogeberry Pi makes me a little sad because adding the PiJuice HAT prevents me from using the case it came with. Also, I did have a problem with cooling for the POC I did because it had no protection from the sun or any way to actively move air over the heatsinks. I would be willing to pay someone handsomely for a 3D printed theme mashup of Dogecoin and Pirates of the Caribbean
* Professional Services and Support offerings
* Training courses
* Building tooling for easier management
* Gamification around producing solar power for the Dogeberry Pi. Maybe a points/ranking system
* I‚Äôve never had my hands on a Tesla PowerWall. Are there any opportunities for a tight integration between that Dogeberry Pi and the wall unit?

## 

## The Ask

This proposal is complex and the most elegant way to implement this paradigm is on the Dogecoin blockchain itself. It will take time for all of us to discuss Proof of Useful Work and come to a consensus. In the meantime, I have a way to produce the same effect without having to modify Dogecoin Core itself. Running Kubernetes on all of the Dogeberries allows us to tie all of them together into one big pool of compute. If we put an API and a payment portal in front of the fleet then we have a product where companies can pay fiat currency to use compute and the fiat currency is automatically converted to Dogecoin for payout to pool participants.

I believe that I can build this with the support of the community. In my previous posts, I invoke the idea of ‚Äúwe at Aither‚Äù but to be honest, Aither is still a company of 1 --myself-- and it‚Äôs a company on paper as there is zero revenue at the moment; i‚Äôm still building my prototype. The truth‚Ä¶ is that i‚Äôm just a regular guy. I work a day job to pay the bills‚Ä¶ yet also, I am that proverbial guy in his garage building things, willing to challenge the status quo. Through hard work, a bit of luck, the support of loved ones, and the grace of god I was able to overcome some economic boundaries and help lift my family into the middle class; since then i‚Äôve made it my mission to extend that hope to as many people as I possibly can. People deserve to live life with dignity and self respect. They shouldn‚Äôt have to choose between buying medication to avert some debilitating symptoms or putting food on the table for their children or grandchildren; affordable healthcare is a whole ball of wax unto itself. Putting a good, honest 40 hours of work in per week should guarantee a livable life and there should be no need to get a second or third job just to barely make it over the finish line month to month. Nevermind the fact that one might be one major car breakdown away from losing those jobs and having their whole life come collapsing down upon them. This is the reason I founded Aither, hope for a better future for all of us.

Dogecoin and cryptocurrency in general is a way to break free from aspects of this vicious cycle that dominate so many of us across the world. It can help us start correcting our financial systems and restore power back to the people. This is why I am asking for your financial support in order to quit my day job and develop this pathway full-time. I need a runway in terms of funding so that I can put food on the table for my family while I dedicate my full work-week to the dogecoin community as well as take care of things like:

* Cloud Infrastructure costs for development
* Security
* Hiring contractors for software engineering and to speed up project deliverables
* Security
* Legal analysis
* Security

I was able to put all of this together in a couple months as I scratched time away from my job and family duties. Just imagine if I could dedicate full, consistent time to this endeavor. If any of my work that i‚Äôve presented here is valuable to you or if you would like to support the initiative, please consider donating:

With the fee reduction in the works doge is getting closer to being a competitor with credit card companies.  And some people are spending doge using their coinbase credit card.  Which is great, but it's not what I want from crypto.

Right now when I use my credit card I fill out a customer profile.  So if, in a given day, I donate to wikileaks, buy some bondage gear and purchase a book entitled ""how to make bombs at home"" that all goes into a consumer profile that will be shared with the kind and moral people who run intelligence agencies as well as 'partner' corporations who, I am assured, only have my best interests at heart.

I'd like to avoid the whole consumer profile business altogether.  I should be able to use electronic currency the way I use paper currency. 

TL;DR  **It would be great if I could buy coffee using a dogecoin app** without having to go through Bitpay, Coinbase Visa or the like.

Much wow.  So thanks."

First, is it accurate to say that while there seem to be five core active dogecoin developers, anyone can come in and propose a change, thus expanding the team naturally if there are worthy skills and commits coming in from someone?

Second, not everyone can have a final say to push out a release, correct? That is a control one for more of the current developers have?

Lastly, while the core developers turned down funding from Elon, is there anything really preventing him from hiring some serious developers that participate in the open source code base making suggestions...keeping the open source nature alive?"

6. Are we Fast (small blocktime), and committed to stay fast as the network allows more throughput?
7. Are we on-chain scaling?
8. Or are we focused on Layer-2 for scaling?
9. Or both?  If both, which do we favor most, or do we scale both equally?

0.025,0.926,0.049,0.5487,"A new version of Dogecoin Core, v1.14.4, has been released and can be downloaded from the Github [release page](https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin/releases/tag/v1.14.4). This is a minor update that includes important performance improvements and prepares the network for lower recommended fees, per the [fee policy change proposal](https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin/discussions/2347). It is a recommended update for all shibes.

This release can be installed over an existing 1.14 installation seamlessly, without the need for uninstallation, re-indexation or re-download. Simply shut down your running Dogecoin-QT or dogecoind, perform the installation and restart your node.

Most important changes are:

**Enabling Future Fee Reductions**

Prepares the network for a reduction of the recommended fees by reducing the default fee requirement 1000x for transaction relay and 100x for mining. At the same time it increases freedom for miner, wallet and node operators to agree on fees regardless of defaults coded into the Dogecoin Core software by solidifying fine-grained controls for operators to deviate from built-in defaults.

This realizes **the first part of a two-stage update** to lower the fee recommendation - a followup release will implement the lower fee recommendation, once the network has adapted to the relay defaults introduced with this version of Dogecoin Core.

**Synchronization Improvements**

Removes a bug in the network layer where a 1.14 node would open many parallel requests for headers to its peers, increasing the total data transferred during initial block download up to 50 times the required data, per peer, unnecessarily. As a result, synchronization time has been reduced by around 2.5 times.

[Full release notes are available on GitHub](https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin/blob/4c93783ab64ba96e60b7ea37202c072c66f3f544/doc/release-notes.md)

I know that Teslas have Nvidia chips in them, would it be possible to use those chips to mine the Scrypt algorithm while the car is parked?  I'm sure it wouldn't be as profitable as an ASIC but it would help further decentralize the network, incentivize people to buy Teslas (the car helps pay for itself), and the feature could even be set to only work if the car was charged or is connected to a ""green"" source of electricity.

Another thought that I had is some kind of incentive for miners to buy a Tesla solar roof and/or Powerwall.  This would have the same benefits and incentives as mining in the cars (offsetting equipment cost, ""green"" energy).  This could come in the form of either a rebate on purchasing the equipment if it's paid for in Doge, or some kind of discount or exclusive offer on the ASIC miners themselves if you own a solar roof or Powerwall.

0.035,0.801,0.165,0.9981,"Good day to the devs, the community, Elon, Gene, Snoop and any other celebrity investors. I'm here today to talk to you about THE BIG PICTURE related to CC and Doge in particular. Today we shall have adult conversations about monetary systems, particularly the current one we are using and the role of CC and Dogecoin as it related to the future of humanity and what the role of Dogecoin and CC in general can do and be for humanity . At the core of this is a complex yet simple quandary, the creation of currency for humanity to use as a means of exchange and a store of wealth without the creation process being corrupted, as it is now.  The following bullet points are pertinent to the following conversation and statements and need to be addressed individually within the context of Dogecoin and how it can ""fix"" existing problems.

1. Understanding the current central banking systems . ie understanding the ""carny"" ""usury"" ""authority"" scam that it is. Understanding the private ownership of the ""rights to create currency""  ""government backed"" currency and just what going on here in so far as the creation process is concerned 
2. Understanding the political ramifications of the present system of currency creation as it pertains to taxation and social services for said populations under the rule of these monetary systems, as well as how the elimination of current systems would effect the current political systems, both in the USA and the globe in general
3. How Dogecoin can be used to ""take back"" the power of currency creation from the present group of criminals not only in the USA but globally and to give that back to the people and allow for an even playing field for all in their pursuit of happiness.
4. The absolute importance of the coin count being ""infinity"" 
5. the absolute importance of Dogecoin being valued in itself and the start of the process of weening ourselves off central bank created currency  and to truly start the process of 1 Doge = 1 Doge
6. the reality that Dogecoin could be the opportunity to do what Bitcoin was supposed to do...., or what the early adopters had hoped for,get rid of central banking and fraudulent taxation that is being extracted under the guise of paying for ""social services"" and ""government"" And how Dogecoin can have realistic social service costs factored into the creation process in order to serve humanity, not to parasitically suck us dry.
7. The reality is that a ""proper, well functioning honest, global monetary system has the ability to 1. stop war, 2. promote resource sharing instead of hoarding 3. to both act locally but also positively effect global changes for all 4. shift humanities focus onto real problem solving and quality of life issues for all. Conserve and preserve the natural environment through innovative mind share related to tackling some of the larger problems facing the world today.

I ask you to not think to yourself, how much is my Dogecoin worth, but to think of it's increasing value as ""we're"" that much closer to ending this charade without resorting to violence.

This BIG PICTURE due diligence conversation will happen over several days and several posts where I will go over the bullet points individually in order to give each one the detailed conversation that it requires and will encourage others to participate in brainstorming sessions as the topics unfold, and I welcome tangent thoughts and conversations and will say that anything goes as long as its about trying to turn Doge coin into the peoples currency and to ween ourselves off central bank money.

* Port all the protocol changes that make up the DOGE asset and the Dogecoin chain security. This roughly consists of:
  1. The chain and asset identifiers, blocktime, issuance/subsidy and scrypt 
  1. Digishield and other feature enablement
  1. AuxPoW
* Set up softforks for enablement of new protocol/consensus functionality
* Brand everything as Dogecoin (UI and help texts)
* Add Dogecoin specific wallet features such as the paper wallet generator

Currently the first two items of phase 1 are done, and only AuxPoW remains to close off this phase. We have draft code for this in [https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin/pull/1974](https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin/pull/1974), and we‚Äôll be breaking that huge pull request down into smaller requests which can be meaningfully reviewed. Once this is done, we can move on to enable new functionality.

Once all of these are in, we‚Äôll then be looking at mining on 1.21, and after that branding (as in, making it look like Dogecoin) will come in, along with UI changes. You can track this work on the [project board](https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin/projects/4).

  Developing an app/software that allows subscribers to cash their paychecks (part or all?) early, using Dogecoin as the payment transactor, and of course offering to allow the user to purchase doge in the transaction, or even convert the entire amount into doge at the current market rate to equal the payment amount. This could be beneficial in a lot of ways, this app could act as a dogewallet or link to a dogewallet allowing the user to regularly purchase dogecoin in increments, as well as link to other apps that connect doge holders with companies that accept doge as payment, so that it in a way becomes its own ‚Äúbank account‚Äù for lack of a better term.

**2021** *-Scale 2x current-*

1. Reduce min tx fees to below 1 cent in 1.14.4 update. Elon suggests 100x reduction, I suggest 200x (which would put us at half a cent when we hit $1)
2. Once fee is reduced, monitor blocksize for 3 months. See if the blocksize increases significantly and we have any spam issues. I anticipate blocksize will not change significantly and there will be no spam issues. Continue to address current node syncing issues.
3. If blocksize is stable, implement segwit and double max blocksize to 2mb at the same time in 1.21 update.

**2022** *-Scale 8x current-*

1. Address any issues with segwit and monitor that blocksize is stable.  Finish up addressing node syncing issues.
2. Once everything is stable, reduce blocktime by one-half to 30 seconds. Monitor syncing and orphan rate. Orphan rate should always stay below 10%.
3. Once everything is stable double blocksize again (to 4mb). Monitor for spam and adjust min tx fee accordingly. Implement lightning code as needed.

**2023** *-Scale 16x current-*

1. Once everything is stable reduce blocktime by one-half to 15 seconds. Monitor syncing and orphan rate.

**2024** *-Scale 40x current-*

1. Once everything is stable Increase max blocksize to 10mb (10x bitcoin and our current blocksize). Adjust min tx fee as needed to keep blockchain growth under control and in-line with our recommended full node specifications \*.

**Beyond** *-Scale potentially 100x + current-*

1. As orphan rate approaches 5% consider future incremental blocktime decreases to eventually 6-7 seconds or faster depending on how we can stay synced and maintain orphan rate below 10%.
2. If we get to the point that block space is limited and fees are increasing, consider increasing max blocksize while keeping to parameters of node syncing and orphan rate.

\***Notes:**

* Of course we will need to change block reward every time blocktime is updated to maintain a constant emission of 10,000 coins per minute.
* We need to develop metrics and measures for orphan rate and syncing rate.
* We need to develop suggested specifications for full nodes and required specifications for full nodes. RAM, processor speed/cores, and storage space should be specified. We need to consider that each full node does the job of the entire paypal server farm and therefore a rudimentary server will be required if we progress beyond a hobby project. In light of this we need to make running a ""pruning node"" easily selected from the core wallet.
* If energy usage / asic unavailability due to chip shortage becomes a serious issue and is causing potential centralization, consider change of PoW algorithm to [ProgPoW](https://github.com/ifdefelse/ProgPOW) which is a well developed ASIC resistant GPU friendly hashing algorithm. If energy use or GPU availability becomes a major concern, there is always the CPU algo [Yespower](https://github.com/openwall/yespower).
* If Proof of Work proves way too slow or other serious problems with PoW arise (in other words; ""if all else fails""), we can consider a change to PoS or Proof of Rest [\#1942](https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin/issues/1942) or some other solution. Or PoS as a layer 2 [\#1924](https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin/issues/1924).
* We should also do research into how our nodes sync with having our nonce in other chains' (we are merge mined with all scrypt coins, not just Litecoin) blockchain and how that effects our syncing, if at all.
* Consider improving/tweaking payout protocols for development contributions with the goal that someone can quit their job and work full time on dogecoin development with minimal risk.
* Consider Zk-Rollups support for layer 2 as an addition to Layer 2 lightning."

0.038,0.889,0.073,0.9243,"Let me preface this by saying, I'm not a coder, don't know cryptography, and this could all be gobbledygook.

A month or two ago I discovered Solana used a blockchain clock to help resolve their network efficiency/security.

&#x200B;

I started thinking that perhaps this could also be used in the context of a proof-of-work model. Like if say, events had a proofed time, then orphan block fairness, maybe even the need for confirmations could be resolved.

&#x200B;

A lot of proof of work mechanisms are actually striving to resolve time using propagation as a proxy (which is slower), or network timings as a padding.  You don't know when transactions occur, so you use confirmations via propagation. You don't know when blocks are mined, so that constraints block-time. Time is worked around, because there is no absolute sense of time.

Solana uses a specific variation of a Verifiable Delay Function ([https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/601.pdf](https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/601.pdf)), in their words:

""*Our specific implementation uses a sequential pre-image resistant hash that runs over itself continuously with the previous output used as the next input. Periodically the count and the current output are recorded.*""

They use SHA-256, and apparently this implementation is pretty much impossible to parallelize (ie must run single core). I'm not honestly sure of Scrypt could be used in the same way.

It's explained here:

[https://medium.com/solana-labs/proof-of-history-a-clock-for-blockchain-cf47a61a9274](https://medium.com/solana-labs/proof-of-history-a-clock-for-blockchain-cf47a61a9274)

Because it's single core, and the speeds at which ASICs running SHA-256 are predictable, they can also approximate the bounds in which this can be speed up (30% or so). Making it, so within these boundaries, they can have certainty of it's honesty. As far as I understand it, because it's published, uses unique input data, and it's sequential, it cannot be modified retrospectively nor can the hashes be reused. Linked to specific events (ie with those events as input data), like transactions and blocks, it should make those events also non-malleable.

I heard that originally Satoshi actually wanted to implement a blockchain clock prior to settling on his solution for bitcoin. In a sense, proof of work acts as a clock. I wonder is this still possible to integrate a clock with tighter timing into a Proof-of-Work system?

I have no idea if this is doable, but it does seem to me one of the central design flaws of proof of work is not knowing time. If it was possible to create a reliably proofed time, some slower mechanisms could be replaced or eliminated. Orphan blocks, in theory at least would then come down not to centralization but how much lost work is tolerable to miners and the network - which in itself would come down to efficiency and network speed.

If confirmations aren't able to be eliminated, they could at least be reduced. Of course efficiency in blockchain propagation itself would be key - if there's too much variability, it would limit the use of this.

Please accept again, that I am not a coder, and I could have all this wildly wrong. I do grasp though that this would essentially be completely altering how the chain propagates and how immutable history functions, and is by no means a simple thing."

Cause there's no regulation. We talk alot about fiat and how that's infinite aswell, but unlike Doge. There are burning facilities to regulate the amount of fiat so it wont get too low.

An idea for Doge is to adopt the same method. To have burning facilities. Simply to balance the infinite supply.

Id suggest a ""tax"" on transactions. And that tax went directly into a burning wallet. If doge got mass adoption this could potentielly result in a raise of price. And the procentage that gets burned could be increased/decreased based on the amount of people that adopts it. The more people who adopts it the less the tax.

I know people don't want taxes on their gains, but ask yourself this. Would you rather have no tax and Doge at a lower price or would you have tax and Doge at a higher price? Im not talking $5 - $100 price. Im talking $1 as stablecoin. If Doge should become the people's coin. It cant surpass the $1 benchmark. I know people want Doge to skyrocket to double digit dollar, but that's nlt healthy for Doge. It wont become the people's coin. Not everyone can afford to buy something that coats $10+.

0.147,0.725,0.128,-0.9867,"Hello all, there's a lot of reasonable discussion regarding transaction fees lately. Most of those claims are that transaction fees are too high, and make small transactions unreasonable. Folks are weighing in and saying that transaction fees should be in the 1/2 a cent range, or around 0.01 DOGE by current price (\~$0.5). Elon Musk, a business man and active Twitter user, has personally asked for a 100X reduction in DOGE fees (around 1/20 of a cent). I wanted to formulate a post to align the discussion around the metrics, and clarify why transaction fees exist.

**On the subject of transaction fees**: by associating a cost with a transaction (TX), you solve an important problem: you limit spam TXs which can be harmful to a cryptocurrency. With the current TX fee, DOGE is extremely spam-resistant. But, before we move on, there are two other considerations: (1) by including a fee, miners receive an additional payment outside of the typical block rewards (subsidy) and (2) you provide a means for TX speed competition, where miners are able to set personal limits on fees. Assuming wallets are implemented well, the miners will be able to compete (lowering fees to solve more transactions, like a company acquiring clientele) and you will get the best TX fee at any given time. In relation to spam, this will allow miners to lower their prices to attractive amounts - but won't remove the fee entirely, ensuring a spam attack isn't feasible. With the current relay strategy, this is not being encouraged as much as it could be. **Luckily, this is something the devs are aware of**. So the next part is basically going to be a scale of the considerations, and hopefully you can identify if there is anything I've missed.

Considerations \~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

**Miners**: miners aren't a priority in determining fees. While they do receive an additional payment from fees, it's a side-effect rather than a priority. A coin \*can\* exist without fees, or extremely low fees, and it will still have miners so long as they see a potential in the coin's appreciation, or if the coin has enough use-cases to be valuable and worth the mining process.

*IMO: Miners should not be considered when calculating fees. They should be happy with what they get! Which is roughly 70 DOGE per block currently.*

**Spam**: limiting spam is the #1 priority. So this becomes a vulnerability consideration; how much spam will harm the coin, who would want to do this harm, who has the ability to do this harm, and how can we prevent it.

*IMO: Threats could range all the way from a government (\~200 million USD) down to commercial bad actors (\~10 million USD) per attack. Commercial bad actors are the most likely threat vector. A coin is harmed by spam when the block space begins to fill each minute, and as a result the fee increases or disrupts node syncing. The DOGE max block size is 500Kb so the theoretical transactions per second would be 33 TX/s. At 1,980 TX/min, 1981 TX would begin to cause problems. The average TX/min is 22 TXs, so that would require roughly 1959 TX/min of spam, climbing towards 1980 TX/min. To truly affect the chain, this would need to occur, sustained, over multiple days/weeks/months.*

**Cost**: This sort of builds into the above. It can be built by two considerations: (1) how much spam would be required to harm the chain by increasing costs; once you know that you can estimate a cost-value with that. (2) How valuable is preventing spam? This one is less important, but will come into play when selecting a realistic threat.

The second big consideration for cost is, cost of using the coin. To be a realistic currency, using the coin shouldn't be a high cost relative to what you can buy. Because of this, the desire to keep fees low is strong.

*IMO: we should start with the second part of the first consideration and the second part of the whole consideration to form a baseline limit. Taxes are roughly 2.5-8% for everyday items. DOGE TXs should probably be less than that because then you are paying double taxes for each TX. But realistically, $0.01USD is unnoticeable, so we know the limit should be between $0.01 and 8% of a cup of coffee, or $0.16.*

*Next we can determine the cost of sustaining an attack for a series of time intervals at a series of costs. To describe the attack, it would take roughly $42,768,000 to fill 1980 TX/min @ 1DOGE (\~$0.5) ea. for one month. Considering a commercial bad actor with a sustained attack for a week, the cost associated with this scenario should be more than $10 million. If we consider that a cup of coffee is purchased for every TX (@$2/cup) that would amount to an 8% tax associated value of $3,193,344. If the $0.16 fee is used, it would bring the cost of a weekly attack to $13,885,344 which is above the limit of a commercial bad actor, but not unreasonable. At $0.01 TX fee, the total cost would be $10,891,584, which is fairly close to the potential threat. Given more detail and technical figures, we could probably draft a realistic scenario which facilitates a strong TX fee.*

Spam Solutions\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

Transaction fees are just one solution to the spam problem. Other solutions have been tried by other coins, such as the back-log process for Nano which they implemented recently in response to a spam attack. There is also the Throughput model, where a sending address must provide proof-of-work (PoW) on two other transaction, thereby turning the spammers into workers. There is the reputation model, which would require a central authority to grant reputation to approved senders (not at all recommended for DOGE).

Overall, there is some initial justification to decrease the TX fees, absent of other improvements to the process. Thoughts?

EDIT: Just wanted to clarify, **this is something the devs are aware of**. I am making this post to share my analysis and ask for thoughts, improvements, suggestions from the community."

0.018,0.834,0.148,0.9942,"I've seen quite a few people on various subs and social media suggesting the idea of including bounties for completing helpful projects that advance work on the coin. I've engaged in a few productive conversations about this and here is my suggestion for how it could possibly work.

Before this is brought up- I have seen that there is a developer fund that compensates contributing developers upon a major release. However I wonder if an individualistic approach to these rewards could be more motivating, as it is often a fairly large amount of time between major releases.  Visible, scaling rewards could assure them that they will receive something timely that is appropriate to their contribution.

I understand that the major problem whenever funding projects is brought up is that the Developers rightfully do not want to be beholden to any one entity. Retaining decentralization is vital, it is what this is all about after all. So there are two ways I could see this working.

The core Developers supply projects for the community to engage in at varying levels. Upon completion and pending review, a reward is given which is scaled to the complexity of the project, time spent, etc. These variables could be decided on by the devs before the bounty is issued, and the guidelines for successful completion could be posted for anyone wanting to attempt to complete the bounty, so that there is no confusion. This could help motivate more progress (and more effective, focused help) without compromising any of our ideals.

Or

The community decides what projects they want to work on. After completion of a project, the core Developers vote together to decide whether a given project is helpful or not. Then, rewards are decided on and scaled to usefulness (a tier system could be implemented to measure this), project complexity, etc.

Initially I had considered this working from a broader consensus..but I understand that the devs would probably want the voting parties to be subject matter experts. That said, I do believe that some sort of additional organizational infrastructure can be built here without risking centralization or involving any hierarchy that does not already exist.

Finally, if this is a redundant post I apologize, I've tried to comb through and see if this has been brought up before (and in how much detail) but there is a lot to read through atm. I just wanted to spark some helpful conversation. As has been said before, thanks for all you do guys. I'm really happy to see the community at large engaging in these projects and I hope I can find plenty of ways to help moving forward."

Ross talked about how it wasn't a good idea to do upgrades more than every 18 months because it takes nodes that long on average to upgrade.

One possible reason for this is because they feel they are only 1 upgrade behind so it is not a big deal.  But if they got a couple upgrades behind they might feel more urge to upgrade.  The slow pace of development feeds into the thought of everyone that there just isn't that active of development on dogecoin, and no pressing need to update.

Also people could read the update notes and just decide that they weren't experiencing any issues that the upgrade fixed, so why upgrade?

Another possible reason is there have been many reports of encrypted wallets not opening in future versions, this scares people to upgrade and risk that perhaps their passcode doesn't work anymore.  So people are afraid to upgrade.

In conclusion I think if there were more recent and more impactful updates, the adoption rate would improve from 18 months it currently sits at.  The developers set the pace of the network, they shouldn't follow the least common denominator.

MishaBoar in the comments brings up several good points including one point that perhaps the 18 month adoption curve is actually decreasing, with the popularity 1.14.3 has probably been widely adopted well before the 18 month mark.  It would be good to get confirmation on this."

They came together in what felt like a few days to reach the funding amount and the rest is now history. That kind of community alignment was easier to do when the community was small and I think for the size we are at today this approach no longer works.

I have my own theories on how these institutions are laundering money in crypto to move stock prices, so I wanted to dig deeper into it by analyzing transaction histories on a few initial wallets. While I've tried pulling out info using wallet viewers and block viewers(like: [https://bitinfocharts.com/dogecoin/](https://bitinfocharts.com/dogecoin/)), my project is going to require that I analyze thousands of transactions and potentially hundreds of accounts, so manually scraping data is not reasonable.

I have a deployed 1.21 node, which is good, although there's definitely work be be done on 1.21 still:

* The deployed node syncs headers but it does not appear to request blocks from its peers. Even more confusingly, running 1.21 on my local machine _does_ sync blocks.
* Bitcoin Core 0.21 (which Dogecoin Core 1.21 is based on) is designed for DNS seeds which support version bits, ours do not, which means it reports that it finds zero nodes from the seeds. Work on enabling our DNS seeds to support this is already underway.
* Dogecoin Core 1.21 does not appear to discover nodes at all, right now, although if nodes are manually added, or connect _to_ the node, it works.
* The functional test suite needs validating after AuxPoW has been added, which may resolve some of these bugs as a side-effect.

Once those are out of the way, there's a bunch of more minor things to tweak so we can start mainnet testing, and then rebranding.

Dogecoin transactions will have a fee defacto of (negative) 1000% the current.

ETH is on blockchain which is a digital ledger across many hundreds of thousands of computers, if not millions. Blockchain can be used across a spectrum of applications, with a focus on security.

Blockchain allows for decentralized currency. Governments and religious powers do not influence the ability to transact.

Stable coins are assets and will be investible.

ENS of ETH can turn a wallet into a identity for use across social media platforms as well as any other means of use.

Dynamic block size will increase, or decrease, based on (current) demand by a factor of 1-2 times. (Blocks will be larger or smaller by demand).

IF the transaction fees become higher than the blockchain potential there could be a decrease in ETH supply at a decreasingly amount over time.

This will be a pathway for ETH to burn as well as, and hopefully likely, Dogecoin."

1. Buy and use Dogecoin, helps expand it's uses
2. Have your business accept Dogecoin,  dah dah dah
3. Create node only, increases transaction speeds (im guessing?)
4. Create full node and mine coin

[Switch to Proof of Interaction, an algorithm that requires small amount of computational power while being secure. \[feat\] ¬∑ Issue #2059 ¬∑ dogecoin/dogecoin (github.com)](https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin/issues/2059)

**Full paper here:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.07763](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.07763)

*Proof of Interaction* requires a small amounts of computational power that is resistant to selfish mining. In addition, it solves the issues of Proof of Work's computational power and Proof of Stake's security issues.

**How it works**

""when a user wants to access a resource in a server that is heavily requested, the server can ask the user to perform a tour of a given length in the network. This tour consists of accessing randomly a list of nodes, own by the same provider as the server. After the tour, a user can prove to the server that it has completed the task and can then retrieve the resource.""

**Here are some keypoints:**

* Uses less computational power than Proof of Work
* More secure than Proof of Stake
* Resistant to selfish mining, meaning everyone is equal, doesn't matter whether if Bob has a more powerful computer than Alice.

So far, no proof of concept was currently made for the algorithm. This thread is a continuing discussion.

0.147,0.723,0.13,-0.1179,Any one with the info if dogecoin decentralisation from the whales is in positive or negative direction? What is the status quo?
0.041,0.896,0.062,0.594,"I was thinking about the whale pump and dumper problem and thought of something. We already see this in payment-related services and that's putting transaction limits based on x number of transactions done in y time, or z value of transactions done in y time, or a combination of both. So why not have a cooldown timer where when you send a certain amount, programmatically, the cooldown will take into effect depending on the amount you send.

For example, every time a single Dogecoin wallet sends:

- 1-9,999 sent: +5 minute cooldown
- 10,000 - 24,999: +10 minute cooldown
- 25,000 - 49,999: +30 minute cooldown
- 50,000 - 99,999: +2 hour cooldown
- *For every 100,000: +3 hour cooldown
- *For every 1,000,000: +48 hour cooldown

For every 100k you send, There is a cooldown time of +2 hours. For every 1m sent, it's +48 hour cool down. So if you send 1.5m, that's 48h + 15h = 63h cooldown

In this way, the would-be pump and dumper cannot keep on sending a ton in a short period of time. This can be adjusted later on as the Dogeconomy evolves.

In the Tron network, there's other parameters like Energy and Bandwidth which limit what you can do with your TRX. You have to freeze TRX to gain Energy/Bandwidth. Since Dogecoin doesn't have this, maybe programming a cooldown timer might be feasible without too much work to add.

If that's not enough, because a whale bot can probably control multiple wallet addresses, then add a fee that scales when sending 500000+ Doges? The network needs to make it very expensive for pump and dumpers to execute their ladder attacks.

Just another set of ideas to add to the pile, what do you guys think?"

0.008,0.904,0.088,0.9731,"Hope everyone is having a good day. A few years ago, I stored some Doge in a MultiDoge wallet. After storing, I got really busy and could not pay much attention to the wallet. For safety, I protected the wallet with a password. I then made a backup of the wallet, to keep in a separate drive. 

&#x200B;

Some time after, I changed the hard drive (HD) on my computer (kept the old one just in case I needed it). However, when I tried to access the old HD this year, I was unable to access it. My guess, the drive got corrupted, and since the OS was encrypted, I don't think that the regular recovery software would work (please correct me if any of you know any software tools for recovering an SSD, with Ubuntu hard drive/OS encryption, that got corrupted). 

So I tried using the backup I created before changing the HD on my computer, but now I face another issue. Apparently, when I made the backups, since I was still starting with crypto, I did not manually export the keys. HOWEVER, it seems that MultiDoge did an automatic backup of the keys to the ""multidoge-data/key-backup/"" directory, which got copied with my wallet backup. However, this key must be either encrypted or encoded in some way, because the format is not the correct format for a doge wallet key. I tried to import this key when I tried to restore the MultiDoge wallet on my new SSD, but the client is not recognizing my password. 

&#x200B;

Does anyone here know how the original wallet key can be recovered from this backup key file?

Does anyone know where in the source code is the key backup generated or where the multidoge-data directory get updated? I tried looking through the source code but couldn't find this.

In 2014, I  acquired dogecoin for around 2 months through various transactions on  ebay and other means. Up until last week, that laptop sat on a shelf  with a dead battery and no internet connection whatsoever.

At  the beginning of this month, I downloaded a new 64 bit wallet, overwrote the wallet.dat file and allowed the wallet to update and  download the blockchain.

As it  finished this morning, I realized that on 5/6/2021, a -50,000  transaction had occurred WITHOUT any knowledge whatsoever on my part. My  old and new wallets show as being fully locked and no passphrases were  EVER given out, printed or ever looked at.

Looking  into more detail into this ""transaction"", it is CLEAR someone STOLE my  coins by tracking down an older transaction and redirecting it into  THEIR wallet. This is the address of the thief:    DGoBxd82tyyhPBbd1qcmAdqJVsWyANnNsQ

By the looks of the wallet's activities, this one account has been doing this for a few weeks now:

[https://dogechain.info/address/DGoBxd82tyyhPBbd1qcmAdqJVsWyANnNsQ](https://dogechain.info/address/DGoBxd82tyyhPBbd1qcmAdqJVsWyANnNsQ)

How  can something like this happen? I can prove the 50k transaction I  originally made because the addresses are clearly in the blockchain.

Here is the specific transaction of my STOLEN coins: [https://dogechain.info/tx/759bb9e9ea8cc7d13053fa5376555150cd899f850d07124853d67d9717349857](https://dogechain.info/tx/759bb9e9ea8cc7d13053fa5376555150cd899f850d07124853d67d9717349857)

The address the coins were taken from is a random RECEIVING address I gave the guy who I bought the coins from.. How is this possible?

Now, unless I'm a complete idiot and messed up severely - This is a very serious matter and a very serious breach of security. I would love some feedback on this from someone smarter than me.

Should a NEW doge wallet be updated (blockchain) BEFORE copying an old wallet.dat file over? 

UPDATE on the wallet - I downloaded the wallet on 5/10/2021 so this happened BEFORE I had any kind of wallet online. So they stole the coins right of the blockchain??

Higher rewards for transactions are more appealing  for the miner, i understand.

But what if dogecoin transactions would have a priority system?

As it is the coin of  people, priorities should be done counting transactions of a wallet per day. if it is the first transaction (such send or much receive) of a wallet its prio 1, second is prio 2 etc.  like a normal consumer has like 30 Transactions per day . So we could reset the priorisation iterator  with the rise of the moon (nightfall). or maybe you can set it to whatever (24+) time you want... to seperate your transactions ""in the middle"".

the assigned priority could be increased per time.

With this we would solve a part of the fan in / fan out problem don't we?

Could something like this be implemented in DOGE?

0.034,0.893,0.074,0.8425,"Hello shibes.

As many of you have noticed, other cryptos's blockchain explorers often list, next to some of the top wallets, the name of the exchange holding that wallet. As an example, [https://bitinfocharts.com/top-100-richest-bitcoin-addresses.html](https://bitinfocharts.com/top-100-richest-bitcoin-addresses.html), [https://nanocharts.info/](https://nanocharts.info/), or [https://adaex.org/richlist](https://adaex.org/richlist).

I have spent so much time answering people saying that Dogecoin is in the hands of few holders and also thanks to the insistence of guys like Hoskinson, some people still want to believe the top wallet is not an exchange, even though we have had users investigating into it and proving it in a way that leaves little or no space to any doubt, such as in the case of the DH5 wallet: [https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/lkwnny/mystery\_solved\_the\_billionaire\_dogecoin\_whale\_aka/](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/lkwnny/mystery_solved_the_billionaire_dogecoin_whale_aka/). Users like u/Fulvio55 have also tracked some hot wallets back to Binance, according to his past posts.

Now, you might  say ours are just ""speculations"" (at least those concerning cold wallets, since hot wallets are easier to track back to an exchange through withdrawals and deposits). But as a matter of fact, the ownership of the top wallets shown in bitinfocharts for Bitcoin or for nano in [https://nanocharts.info/](https://nanocharts.info/) and so on for many other cryptocurrencies comes from the same kind of speculation  that u/AndreiFromAlberta did in the DH5 thread. **The difference is that for BTC, bitinfocharts has no problem listing that kind of speculation as fact, whereas for Dogecoin they are not doing the same.**

This is a problem for us, because whenever I try to make people understand some of the top wallets cannot be anything but cold/hot wallets for exchanges, I am pointed to lists such as [https://bitinfocharts.com/top-100-richest-bitcoin-addresses.html](https://bitinfocharts.com/top-100-richest-bitcoin-addresses.html), [https://nanocharts.info/](https://nanocharts.info/) as proof that Bitcoin is different in comparison with Doge, whereas the situation is substantially the same.

Can we do a community push to collect information about all the top wallets and then ask the major Dogecoin explorers (bitinfocharts, [dogechain.com](https://dogechain.com) [sochain.com](https://sochain.com)) to list the identity of the wallet holders as it is being done for almost any other crypto?

So, we would need to first gather proof for each of the top 20-30 wallets, like Andrei did for the DH5 wallet, and then contact the Dogecoin blockchain explorers to add a note like they do for other exchanges next to each wallet."

Background:
Blockchain is a financial instrument. The best blockchain must be build for an economic global model, addressing a form of monetary policy to keep stability and balance for its supply and output. The priority should be finance first then the right code to make it more efficient, not the reverse. It should be flexible and responsive to dynamic global market changes while finding the right balance to mitigate hyperinflation and economic downturn. Understanding global finance requires global monetary policy and other factors such as Quantitative Easing - increasing coins minted, and increments of coins burned. An Ai model should be trained and encompass aforementioned factors as well as others to continue mass adoption and become a global reserve currency. 

Doge needs to move forward from Gen 1 (POW) blockchain architecture and get some cutting edge ai tech. 

Maybe Elon's elite engineers at OpenAi can help with this. üôè



Features: 

True decentralization - Difficulty Hash rate monitored per Geo-location grid. After allotted hash rate in an area has been exceeded (deemed a hot spot), increase the difficulty hash rate for that area. Renders large scale mining farms unprofitable. Thus, incentivizes for an abundancy of smaller miners and to spread out geographically. Can confirm their actual locations through GPS tags and kept anonymous on the network to prevent miners tracing down others for anticompetitive measures.


-Ai tx spam filter - allow 0 fee transactions and can mitigate spam - like gmail spam filter 

-Ai dynamic block size / optimized block speed - increase block size when network is conjested, then shorten block size when network is slow. orders of magnitude faster 

-Ai dynamic block reward - number of new coins minted per block are decided by a total weighted avg of a variety of market factors such as demand, inflation, twitter sentiment, network activity, current news.


-Ai flexible SHA cryptography - quantum attack resistant 

-Ai controlled small increments of token burn - supply vs demand ratio 

-Ai trained model on monetary policy, QE, economic theories, financial law, news, market fluctuations, global gdp, global trade data, production of goods to control the network. 

-GPT3 can provide quarterly financial blockchain reports made public"

0.028,0.894,0.079,0.9743,"Almost everyone in this community wants to  see Dogecoin successful. However, I keep seeing posts asking for formal organization of Dogecoin or people asking the developers to make changes to Dogecoin (without realizing the negative implications those changes could have) - all in response to Elon Musks tweet. 

Asking the developers questions is fine (I ask them questions all the time) but please stop and think before making a post or reaching out to them. 

Here a few points to consider:

A) Elon musk is not saying that Dogecoin SHOULD have formal organization. He‚Äôs saying it DOESNT have it. That‚Äôs a good thing. 

B) asking for formal organization doesn‚Äôt make sense and counter productive to the point of Cryptocurrency. Cryptocurrency is founded upon decentralized control. Always has been. The control is in the people in the community. Not one person. 

C) Dogecoin is open source. Anyone can work on Dogecoin development if they know how to code and know what they are doing. 

D) The development team has always been working on Dogecoin. Even before Elon Musk. They will continue to do so with or without him. People are only asking about it now because Elon brought it to everyone‚Äôs attention, but the development team has always been very helpful and responding to the community. Just please. Do your research before bringing up a point because odds are - it‚Äôs already been address 1,000 times.

Common things people ask the development team (devs are welcome to reply and clarify any thing if it‚Äôs incorrect) 

1. create a burning system to reduce the supply - already been answered. Not happening. Burning is counter productive anyway. If you want to burn your coins you already can send your coins to a burn address. Stop asking to burn or reduce the supplies of OTHER peoples coins. Not happening 

2. Create a supply cap. Not happening - already been answered. Dogecoin already has a supply cap of 10,000 coins per minute  which turns into 4% yearly inflation rate which is negligible. Having a cap does nothing in terms of the actual value of Dogecoin or bitcoin or practically any other cryptocurrency for that matter at the current moment. The cap only matters once that limit has been reached. The cap for bitcoin doesn‚Äôt happen until 2140. At no point in dogecoins existence has inflation been an issue. Demand is and will continue to be orders higher than any inflation rate. The supply and inflation has already been proven over and over to be a non-issue

3. Transaction speeds and transaction fees. They‚Äôre Working on it - have been for months before Elon‚Äôs tweet

4. Coinbase integration - working on it - have been for months.

5. Anything else - check their GitHub or r/Dogecoindev. They‚Äôve been working on Dogecoin for 8 years. Odds are your question has been answered. If your question hasn‚Äôt been answered THEN consider making a post.

The second is algo - they randomly assign validators so that theoretically only bribes could be used to sway the network (and that would seem in itself unlikely even at 51% attack threshold) - because no one knows who the validators will be in advance. 

What about - both of these two designs? A network with a 75% threshold of attack, and randomly assigned validators could be considered perhaps as unassailable as BTC's proof of work. Without centralization issues.

I'm imagining tx fee schedule based on the number of confirmations of outputs being spent. It might look something like this:

1 doge <1000 conf  >0.1 doge <10,000 conf > 0.01 doge <100,000 conf

This has benefits of reducing spam since you'd need to hold coins several months before low fees kick in. It places a higher fee burden on high frequency spenders/traders. And it rewards casual users since older outputs are charged the lowest fees.

Since dogecoin has BIP068 enabled, implementing this might even be provided through a checksequenceverify script. This has the added economic encouragement for wallet developers to integrate more advanced scripting capabilities to dogecoin wallets.

0.034,0.875,0.091,0.9577,"Dear Dogecoin Developers community,

I am interested in designing a small attachable device to existing payment terminals that will accept DOGE as a payment through NFC on your mobile devices. However, I would like to discuss in details about why? what? how?

&#x200B;

\*Why?\*

With this cryptocurrency transformation going nowadays, more and more online stores are accepting cryptocurrency as a form of payment. The real stores, however, are having hard times. The payment process includes various complicated details such as: setting up the crypto wallet, requesting the payment, navigating through application after scanning the QR code, and many other manual steps that can be automated. For us, in the tech-savvy world, these processes may be neglected, but not for the people that value the time and subconsciously embrace the simplicity. Moreover, the payment cannot be proceeded through NFC, i.e. a way of making it contactless.

&#x200B;

\*What?\*

In the existing market, the major payment manufacturers are VeriFone, Ingenico, CPI, and few more. What I am suggesting is inventing a small payment device that can be either attached to these payment machines, or operate on its own with only one goal of accept cryptocurrencies as a form of payment. The device should be pretty compact, with the size of the USB flash drive(better to be discussed later). Now, once it is connected to the main computer inside the stores, it will:

\-automatically create the wallet for the store owner

\-navigate with the ""cash"" register, so that once the cashier proceeds to the payment stage, the request of ABC Doge will be sent to our device and the customer will use their phone.

This definitely means that the customer needs to have an app that will work with our device.

&#x200B;

\*How?\*

I have experience working with CAD (multiple projects, scientific researches, etc)

Before starting the Product design part, I would like to ask the community of the developers, what else do I need to include within this device. I know the project sounds ""Impossible"", but why not give it a try?

If things move in the faster tx direction it would seem that having a lot of nodes at the chain tip would be super important. Worth incentivizing? 

I am thinking about the PoW energy paradox...I understand the criticism to PoS centralization so instead of rewarding as a function of coin balance, why not reward nodes which are fully synced? This will become increasingly difficult and increasingly important. This would incentivize many many more shibes to run good nodes with quality connections and uptime. 

What are the weaknesses here? A bad actor would have to run a buncha nodes to cause trouble ya, but I suppose they wouldn‚Äôt have to own any doge.

As many of you have noticed, other cryptos' blockchain explorers often list, next to some of the top wallets, the name of the exchange holding that wallet. As an example, [https://bitinfocharts.com/top-100-richest-bitcoin-addresses.html](https://bitinfocharts.com/top-100-richest-bitcoin-addresses.html), [https://nanocharts.info/](https://nanocharts.info/), or [https://adaex.org/richlist](https://adaex.org/richlist).

Several times, on reddit and on twitter, I tried to fight against the FUD surrounding the ownership of the top Dogecoin wallets. Most of them are obviously exchange cold/hot wallets, as anybody who has been into crypto for more than a couple of months would be able to recognize.

Unfortunately, also due to the insistence in spreading misinformation of several media outlets and of guys like Hoskinson, people outside the Doge community  keep spreading the lie that Dogecoin is more unfairly distributed than other cryptos.

We have had users investigating and identifying owners of several top wallets in such a way that leaves little space to any doubt. This is the case of the DH5 wallet, for example: [https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/lkwnny/mystery\_solved\_the\_billionaire\_dogecoin\_whale\_aka/](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/lkwnny/mystery_solved_the_billionaire_dogecoin_whale_aka/). Users like u/Fulvio55 have also tracked some hot wallets back to Binance, according to his past posts.

Now, you might  say ours are just ""speculations"" (at least those concerning cold wallets, since hot wallets are easier to track unequivocally back to an exchange through withdrawals and deposits). But as a matter of fact, the ownership of the top wallets shown in bitinfocharts for Bitcoin or for nano in [https://nanocharts.info/](https://nanocharts.info/) (and so on for many other cryptocurrencies) comes from the same kind of speculation  that u/AndreiFromAlberta did in the DH5 thread linked above. **The difference is that for BTC, bitinfocharts has no problem listing that kind of speculation as fact, whereas for Dogecoin they are not doing the same.**

This is a problem for us, because whenever I try to make people understand some of the top wallets cannot be anything but cold/hot wallets for exchanges, I am pointed to lists such as [https://bitinfocharts.com/top-100-richest-bitcoin-addresses.html](https://bitinfocharts.com/top-100-richest-bitcoin-addresses.html), [https://nanocharts.info/](https://nanocharts.info/) as proof that Bitcoin is different in comparison with Doge, whereas the situation is substantially the same (with the added problem that Bitcoin had a substantial amount of coins mined by very few people).

Can we do a community push to collect information about all the top wallets and then ask the major Dogecoin explorers (bitinfocharts, [dogechain.com](https://dogechain.com) [sochain.com](https://sochain.com)) to list the identity of the wallet holders as it is being done for almost any other crypto?

So, we would need to first gather proof for each of the top 20-30 wallets, like Andrei did for the DH5 wallet, and then contact the Dogecoin blockchain explorers to add a note like they do for other exchanges next to each wallet."

CPU's inherently use even less power than GPU's.  There is an algorithm called YesPower that has proven over multiple years to resist both GPU's and ASIC's and the creator said he would release new versions if ASIC's or GPU's could ever mine it.  This in particular would be great as every dogecoin fan could mine dogecoin themselves on any laptop or PC.

I recently just got out of the U.S military after 10 years and I am now utilizing my GI Bill to get a degree in digital media. I, like many others, first heard about Dogecoin from the Joe Rogan podcast in December of 2020 when Elon Musk was a guest. since then I have been following the Dogecoin community mainly for amusement. This leads me to the title question of How can I help or contribute to the future development of Doge. I have been questioning what I could do (as a novice and new person to coding in general) to learn more and potentially contribute to the future development of Doge. Are there currently Avenues that would allow someone with no Knowledge about coding or Doge to start learning more? What recommendations would someone who's been working as a Doge developer give to an outsider who wants to learn more? These are the types of questions that keep filling my head. The Doge community (from what I've seen) is one of, if not the most supportive online communities I've come across, and I would love to be able to contribute in some way.

0.055,0.877,0.068,0.8584,"I'm flattered that some of you think I am Elon because our ideas for improving the coin have been similar.  Reading this will prove I am not, but we are similar types of people.  We are both Scientists, Engineers, Business owners, and primarily Designers.  We are both idealists.  In one of the companies I worked for, I have actually worked with Tesla engineers as our customer on developing a product for them.  I have never seen a company that was as adamant of us developing a product outside our collective comfort zone as Tesla was.  Since we were not willing to ""cut corners"" as we saw them, it made it very difficult.  I left the company before we completed the design process, but I am curious how it played out.

But doing the impossible is what Elon is all about.  I have worked on and built electric cars including being on electric car race teams.  I can tell you that in the field an electric car that goes 0-60 in 3.2 seconds, 11.8 second quarter mile, and 350 mile range for $40,000 that any customer can buy and is road legal, is nothing short of impossible.  Elon does the impossible regularly, and is used to doing it.  Unless I am personally standing on the landing pad watching a rocket de-orbit and see it land right in front of me, I will continue to believe that landing a rocket with it's rocket engines alone from space is impossible.

So Elon will achieve what he is looking for in a coin, with or without us.  And I can tell you that if it is without us, Doge will go back to $0.01.  His ask is not even that impossible, and is what the community has been pushing towards anyway.

100x fee reduction is something all of us have been wanting.  Heck I think it should be reduced 200x.  Currently Bitcoin Cash has a 1000x cheaper fee than we do, and they are not having any spam problems and their blocks are not full.  Litecoin also has well under 1 cent min transaction fee.  Same with Bitcoin SV and Digibyte.  And unlike these coins, we never have to rely on fees to pay miners since we have a tail emission. This goal is trivial to meet.

10x Blocksize is also not a problem at all.  Many coins have max blocksize this big or bigger with no issues.  Our blocks are basically empty right now.  So obviously we haven't even needed a max blocksize to keep blockchain growth under control.  Average Blocksize will regulate itself which has been shown in all coins including bitcoin, as it took years for them to fill up their first block.

10x reduced blocktime is not that far fetched.  As we know it it is basically impossible for a Proof of Work coin to do 6 second blocktimes with current network effects and technology.  But 10 seconds is in the realm of possibility, and heck, 15 second blocktimes are downright practical; Digibyte has a 15 second blocktime and their orphan rate is currently well under 10%.  In terms of this metric, I propose we take it slow and start with a 30 second blocktime and assess our orphan rate and also syncing metrics.  Our coin will probably struggle achieving very fast blocktimes more so than other coins because we are merged mined and our nonce is routinely in other coins (not just litecoin, we are merge mined with all scrypt coins) blockchains.  Also segwit will likely hurt syncing as well as we will now have 3 places that our data can be; other blockchains for the nonce, transaction blocks for the transactions, and signature blocks for signatures - all of which have to be synced.

Anyway, why not try?  These are all things the community wanted anyway.  We can do the first 2 with no problem, and can work towards the 3rd.  I'm sure Elon would be willing to deploy some satellite and/or fiber nodes to help us achieve the 3rd, and wouldn't that be some cool PR?

Also leaders of Dogecoin need to be customer focused.  Elon is a large customer - one who has caused our price to rise more than any other.  The rest of the community are all customers too, and if we look at them with disdain and judge their motives, that is the farthest thing from customer service we can do.  Of course we have some guiding principles we cannot revoke such as Proof of Work, a coin with our own blockchain (not to become a token), Layer-1 on-chain scaling, and a Tail Emission (un-capped supply).  But when it comes to a roadmap on improving the coin, we should be listening to our customers."

Limit wallet size to say 1 420 069 coins to prevent whales from being able to manipulate the price of the coin

Describe Preferred Solution
Reduce maximum wallet size to 1 420 069

Describe Alternatives
Asking external parties like SEC to prevent market manipulation, which they won't do.

Whales need to buy a lot of coins in order to manipulate the price down by dumping the coins that they bought, if we have a decentralised exchange like metamask where you can swap BTC for DOGE to a maximum wallet size of say 1 420 069 it solves the problem of price volatility to a massive extent. If the volatility is reduced, adoption will follow like a tsunami. Elon will ove this idea because it deals with the price manipulation.

DOGE would absolutely stand out as the peoples coin and solicit mass adoption if the price increase was natural/organic.

Feel free to use my idea to anybody reading this.

Feel free to scrutinize or add to this.

&#x200B;

Idea 1:

Twitter-like Social media platform:

&#x200B;

* Instead of likes or upvotes we tip 1/100 of a dogecoin
* To get around the constant transaction fees, 
* Do what robin hood already does and make it to where you own a tokenized form of dogecoin.
* All the coins go into one wallet and you only pay transaction fees when you deposit/withdraw from the platform.
* Making a post should cost 2/100 of a dogecoin. (sent to app wallet)
* Making a comment should cost 1/100 of a dogecoin. (Sent to the poster)
* If too many comments are sent by one person, incrementally increase the cost of commenting by 2/100 and have a cooldown timer of 3min per increment. To prevent bots.
* Maybe adding a cap on the amount of dogecoin (\~$1000) per account so people can't be too reckless (optional)
* Guarantee their data isn't being sold or tracked.
* People get rewarded for good memes.
* Also good for donations to charity organizations.

&#x200B;

Idea 2:

Gaming platform that is synced with the social media platform

Make gaming tournaments with a 0.01-1 dogecoin entry fee.

For a cashflow, have a $5 per month membership thing..

Heavily restrict the amount for betting on poker and 21 to avoid negative press.

&#x200B;

* Poker
* 21
* Tetris 99
* Fantasy football
* Among us
* Halo combat evolution
* Fall guys
* Fortnite
* Bet on sport events (Probably lots of legal ramifications and can't add)
* Bet on elections (Probably lots of legal ramifications and can't add) 

&#x200B;

Also sponsor current gaming tournaments with huge communities like:

* super smash ultimate
* Counterstrike

From what I‚Äôve learned and seeing so far, unfortunately, until a coin has a risk that could be considered as ‚Äúinvestment grade‚Äù, I don‚Äôt see big institutional investors going all in. In credit rating is pretty straightforward: if you have a BBB rating or above, your bond can be considered investment grade, meaning there‚Äôs some certainty that the security will pay holders its capital and interests in time, thus, attracting institutional investors to jump in. Below BBB-, your securities are riskier since there‚Äôs not relative certainty that you‚Äôll pay your money back with the promised interest, scaring away institutional investors. In this wildly volatile crypto market, investors and the community in general need some perspective on where crypto and Doge are heading to assess investment with more powerful insights. As uncertainty is at its highest due to the pandemic, the consequential world economic crisis we‚Äôre facing, added to social and political unrest in many parts of the world, we need to stand here and have as much certainty as possible. So, how do we create some certainty out of this chaotic multi-systemic uncertainty? In my opinion, as most things over the last 200+ years, with research and development, paired with education. The first idea I might give you is creating some sort of research and education foundation that has the long term goal of overcoming all the current risks and issues that cryptos faces that hinder mass adoption, scare away institutional investors and worry governments, central banks and regulators. This foundation would also have the task of educating and informing all its stakeholders regarding the current risks involved on investing in Doge, the challenges ahead, the milestones achieved, how to help Doge adoption and ‚Äúevangelisation‚Äù regarding its value as currency and investment. Thus, it should invest on research and provide an open source of knowledge and insights that ultimately help investors and the community on decision making regarding the extent of risk that best suits their needs.

The other fundamental role that this foundation would have is leading a ‚Äúgreen crypto world‚Äù, setting up a date for having a zero emission crypto market by 20XX. Again, research, education, information would be fundamental"

Here's how it works: You create notes, and people can comment on those notes (if you make them public). Notes, users, and comments all have their own Dogecoin wallets. When someone deposits money into a Note, the money ""trickles down"" into constructive conversations that unfold in the comments below. 

For example: if someone drops $100 into a note, and ten people make comments, maybe they'd all get varying amounts of cash. The recipients can then either withdraw or deposit money into other notes to draw attention to them / support creators. 

A more concrete example would be to imagine Reddit awards, but where they're actually dogecoin, and they can be converted into cash. And a piece of each award automatically trickles down into high-quality, thoughtful engagement.

I'd love to ask you for your thoughts on this idea ->

**In short the more you participate spending / donating to projects / enterprises that follow the doge ethics of doing good every day the more basic income / universal dividend you get.**

To be fair for all shibes the more basic income you get the harder it is to get even more basic income.

Instead of burning the currently 4% inflation / fees for proof of work a big part could be used for this basic income / universal dividend. **This would also make the energy balance of dogecoin a lot better.**

The projects / enterprises eligible could be voted on through using liquid democracy techniques based on the second layer blockchain.

**How could this look technically?**

This could be implemented step by step in a second layer like dash did it with masternodes / dogemasternodes. Of course newer blockchain tech like one based on cosmos could be used for the second layer.

\- **Since you get more basic income / universal dividend the more you participate in the doge economy, using doge is encouraged very much, which helps adoption of doge to make doge the new number one currency on this lovely planet earth.**

**- DECENTRALIZATION OF POWER: Through using a decentralized blockchain and using liquid democracy techniques**

**THIS WOULD MAKE DOGECOIN TO THE CURRENCY FROM THE PEOPLE FOR THE PEOPLE**

0.07,0.785,0.145,0.9791,"So this is a bit of a far away discussion, for many many decades into the future.   


One problem with most crypto currency is it's FAR too deflationary to be an economic driver. Excess monetary supply results in run away inflation, but too little can lead to *run away deflation* that can be just as disastrous, historically speaking. For example the silver shortage that is thought to have contributed to the collapse of the Ming dynasty.   


Dogecoin is much more suited to this balance of supply and demand with it's supply rate, however, in say 50 to 100 years, dogecoins supply rate may become theoretically too low (as it approaches 0%). So I propose a sort of opposite bitcoin halving - '**Dogecoin Doubling**'.   


When supply increase mathematically falls under let's say 1% per annum (or some other figure, take your pick I'm just guessing), you double the mining rewards. This way it never falls too far below the average economic growth of 2%, and thus shouldn't have the potential for a deflationary spiral due to a wide mismatch of supply and demand.    


It would be best to set a set level of supply increase at which this occurs, so that it was not open to outside influence or central party manipulation. Setting it below average economic growth allows for some natural value appreciation once the market is fully saturated (as opposed to the value depreciation of fiat).   


Now, I know this is a very very future thing, and well, not at all something we are are certain would become an issue. I simply propose it now, so that the idea is floated for future generations of developers, miners and hodlers - should dogecoin ever become a substantial part of the global economy."

0.046,0.767,0.186,0.9914,"One of the challenges with real world transactions using dogecoin right now is that there is no good way to handle delays in the bank-and-forth that normally happens with a transaction. Take the following example:

Problem 1: Shipping/purchase problem

1. Buyer purchases a new bike from Amazon for $1500
2. Amazon verifies that purchasing power equals $1500 for transaction
3. Amazon cannot actually charge the buyer until the bike ships per legal regulations
4. Amazon goes to ship bike, but its 2am and the person getting it ready isn't privvy to the seller's contact info to complete the transaction (transaction fails?)

Problem 2: Recurring payments/e-Bills

1. Buyer agrees to take possession of a case of cleaning supplies every month or to pay an eBill up to certain limit each month
2. Buyer wants to use crypto
3. Seller wants to charge buyer as agreed using subscription pricing or to pay unspecified amount of an ebill, but buyer is now required to enter the transaction whereas historically using a bank or credit card this would not be the case.

It seems to me that the solution would be to create custodian accounts that allow two parties to transact rapidly, and both parties can verify the state of the transaction. A purchase would put money into the custodian account, but the amount doesn't deposit to the merchant until product is shipped. If certain conditions are not met, the custodian would return the amount to the original owner. For recurring purchases, I guess you would just put in enough to cover multiple months of purchases, like a bank.

Is this where smart contracts come in, or is there another solution already designed for this? I'm curious how others have worked out this problem as entities like Amazon consider payments in crypto."

That way, the PoS would be optional, keep the mainnet pure PoW, secure, decentralized with no major changes needed. But some of the txn volume would be offloaded onto the settlement.

Would likely also give fast enough txn's for point of sale, and add to scalability. This would also probably give higher APY than conventional proof of stake, making it incentivized better.

0.027,0.864,0.109,0.9818,"The lightning network is actually a very simple concept.  You create a contract with another party where you both stake say 1,000 dogecoins and that gets approved through the blockchain via being included in a standard block.  Now say your lightning partner owes you 100 doge.  You both sign off on it and now you have 1,100 doge and your partner has 900.  You can keep doing this until one of you runs out of doge.  It can be done one-way too, say you stake 1,000 doge to your amazon account (kind of like buying a giftcard).

Once you run out of balance, you would need to make a new contract and that needs to get broadcast to the blockchain.  You also need to settle the old contract on the blockchain.  So it takes an on-chain transaction to start the pair, and an on-chain transaction to end the pair. Rinse and repeat. [https://medium.com/coinmonks/the-lightning-network-how-to-install-and-hopefully-make-money-6e3058e3fa7c](https://medium.com/coinmonks/the-lightning-network-how-to-install-and-hopefully-make-money-6e3058e3fa7c)

Why do you need to stake the money first?  Because imagine you are in contracts with 2 people and you sign your coins to 2 of them at once.  This is called double spending.  And unless you have a set amount of coins staked to the entity that cannot be spent elsewhere, you can double spend.

The problem with this is most people aren't in relationships where they want to lock away a large amount of money with only 1 trading partner.  It might work well for huge corporations like amazon, but do you still want to commit a large amount of money to trade only with amazon?  If you want to buy something on Ebay and all your money is locked in an amazon pair, then you would have to ask amazon's permission to break the contract.  They would probably charge a fee.

Now imagine a small business you visit rarely.  You wouldn't want to lock money away into that trading pair.  Same with peer to peer payments.

So would it increase speed and reduce congestion on the network?  Perhaps, but only for certain, I would say niche, use cases.  Also we have to realize that people generally don't like locking money to be traded with only one party, so it really won't be a popular solution to the masses.  It's really no different than buying gift cards.

***What are the alternatives?***

Reducing blocktime for faster confirmations, and increasing blocksize maximum (does not effect coin reward) will allow for there to be cheaper and faster transactions where you don't have to lock away any coins to only one person or company.  In addition, these ""alternatives"" can be done alongside the lightning network to improve dogecoin for everyone, not just people in staked trading pairs."

0.059,0.793,0.148,0.9971,"Yeah , so on December 11th 2013, I heard about doge on reddit, joined the sub, and messaged a few different people selling it there, where it was all essentially a giant flea market of doge buyers and sellers via paypal and reddit threads proposing offers / trades.

I really liked the idea of ""Doge"", because you know that feeling you get whenever something has evidently been ""dying to be made fun of"", but you weren't consciously aware of this, until somebody does it seemingly effortlessly, and you go ""damn, that's a good one."" ,

Like the first time I heard the word hipster in 2011, and suddenly a giant trend I wasn't really done becoming aware of, can succinctly fit into one new pejorative somebody smarter than me came up with.

even back in 2013, in that moment, bitcoin was already deserving of this kind of parody, to me anyway.and I guess objectively, because everybody espousing it as the one true god, though largely vindicated, still isn't as vindicated as if they'd just bought doge, starting from the same period lmao. 12/2013

Anyway, that's why I bought doge, I figured, this will go up because it's funny, and the more it goes up the funnier it gets, and the funnier it gets the more people talk and the more they talk the more it goes up and the ..... etc. etc. etc.

So I decided I was sure it'd not go down, from the short term anyway, cause it was new, and I include this because it's probably important to know why somebody would ever spend $530 on 5.3 million doge (attempt to) , even though now days it seems like the best Idea ever, I assure you at the time it was crazy.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

on Decemeber 11th I tried to buy 5 million doge from a guy on reddit, paypal was less than keen on this, and over the course of an hour on the phone with them, and skype with him, they blocked anything I could think to try and get them to let me spend my own money, blocked my atttempts, told me to reset password, didn't work, signed into my sisters paypal, didn't work, my mothers, didn't work etc. all denied.

finally I had to give up, but I had managed to purchase 300,000 doge, for $30, at the beginning of that, before paypal froze me out.

A couple days later, I hit the guy up again, and bought 3,000,000  (for $500, doge was up) using a money card of some kind, I bought at wal-mart, and phoned him the back of / password for.

Then I got really sick, with the flu, and on christmas day when some hack happened, I for whatever reason, asssumed this affected me, and wrote them all off as stolen, in feb 2021, with doge in the news and crypto going nuts, I decided to double check, and sure enough, I found the 300,000 from the night I tried to buy 5,000,000.

But I can't find the 3,000,000 I bought after this, which is odd, because if anything, you'd think there's a better chance of finding the later one, than earlier, especially cause I bought it from I belieev the same person, and he showed me how to get dogecoin core, so why would I set that up, definitively have 300,000 doge in it, and then use something totally different 3-5 days later,

my theory right now, based on old screens of my desktop, is that I for whatever reason, had downloaded dogecoin core twice, and somehow used the second application, the second time, and I'm not able to find this instance of it, nor the directory where the wallet.dat file is stored. I read somewhere that in unix dogecore or btc core can sometimes use a different path /root/something something , as opposed to (i was on mac) /user/Application\_Support/Dogecoin/wallet.dat

is there a chance having downloaded it once already, the second one used a dif path like that?

&#x200B;

or any other ideas that might help?

but yeah that's it, buying that many doge back then , and then believing it was stolen for w.e reason, having protected me from selling early like I would've done, is a stupid and lucky thing that happened to me, and I'm more than happy to pay it forward, and make it a stupid a lucky thing that happened to you too, for helping me find it.

I am restoring a wallet I created in 2014. There is a good amount of coins, some mine, some to a couple friends.

I am looking to sync my wallet to be able to do transactions, but currently, I‚Äôm doing approximately 1% of sync per 24h.

2 questions:
- is this speed normal?
- is there a way to sync my wallet faster ?
- is it possible to upload my wallet.dat to some online wallet to be able to do transactions there ? Would need this to be fairly safe, don‚Äôt want to send it to nowhere.

1. I'm currently working on a project involving DOGE and looking for a *mature* thin SPV node I can use to connect to DOGE peers. **Any hints would be appreciated.**
2. If my search ends without success, I'll ultimately start developing an SPV client myself. Not the end of the world, as I'm familiar enough with Bitcoins technicalities to not get blocked too much. I'd just prefer not to reinvent the wheel and stay productive. **I'd appreciate any hints on resources, tutorials, and similar that decrease the barrier of entry on the SPV topic.** It would be a shame to ignore existing resources others worked so hard to write or collect.
3. In case of #2 I'm additionally considering to wrap the node in a REST or websocket API and make it available to the community for free. I obviously know about my personal use case for this, but **would love to hear about yours and to gauge if there's a demand and to estimate load/cost.**"

0.045,0.787,0.168,0.9872,"This is not moderating advice for a financial development subreddit. I've been seeing a lot of posts that aren't related to the development of dogecoin in this subreddit. 

Don't give me wrong, I'm excited about where the coin is at and I love the memes and shared feelings about it, after all turning a profit by investing in doge has been a lot of fun. But it's getting hard to follow the development of the coin and check for any updates.

One of the reasons I think these kinds of posts are happening is because the icon for r/dogecoindev is the exact same as the one for r/dogecoin. Sometimes I make that mistake myself by not thoroughly checking out the posts on mobile, my brain thinks fast and clicks the post to see what it's about and then it's a comment section saying it's the wrong subreddit. These posts have been more and more frequent since last week and I think it would be helpful to make it more clear what this subreddit is for. I can offer to make an icon for this subreddit, I know a good amount graphic design and mods can feel free to shoot me a DM if interested.

These posts are inevitable, but maybe they can be alleviated a bit with a few changes to how this subreddit is presented. I want to thank everyone here who has contributed to the coin and cares about its future, if it weren't for you this coin would be dead in the water.

....Hear me out....this is for fun and ideas...none of this is an immediate serious suggestion....

My hypothesis is something along the lines of....a long, fair, and widely accessible coin distribution is the most important factor benefitting a crypto currency‚Äôs public adoption. I believe that giving away 10,000 Doge per minute to the public (instead of as block reward) would have tremendous positive impact on the currency‚Äôs value and public adoption, counter to conventional capped supply approaches. 

I like that doge is uncapped. I think maintaining the supply of fresh coin provides a unique opportunity to √ê.O.G.E. and further solidify doge‚Äôs role as the people‚Äôs coin. As it stands today no Doge hodler benefits financially from the block reward anyway. So if consensus and security can (eventually?) be had without a large PoW block reward, how would Doge continue its minting? Traditional staking rewards lead to centralization....instead....what‚Äôs the Shibetobiest thing that could possibly be done with those 10,000 doge per minute? .....**Give the 10,000 coins per minute away for free.** 

This idea hikes it‚Äôs leg and pisses all over the fire hydrant that is hyper-deflationary-moon-coin-rug-pulling.

Here‚Äôs my non-dev, idiot populist vision...y‚Äôall chime in please: 

*Assume doge is low energy, low/0 fee, fast transaction time.... pos, DAG, whatever works and doesn‚Äôt require paying miners. I dunno I‚Äôm an idiot. I just know some cryptos are doing it. 

*Maintain 10,000 doge per minute distributed as follows:

*25% rewarded equally to all Nodes operating at the chain tip or equivalent. 

*25% rewarded to charities which Doge hodlers can delegate to from their wallets. 

*10% public faucet (many low payouts, spam resistant maybe tiny PoW or captcha or something)

*10% geography based faucets (see wenano app) to ensure doge is spread worldwide. Users would be able to claim Doge if they were within a certain physical distance. 

*10% staking reward for doge hodlers

*10% development bounties 

*10% public lottery accessible to anyone who can prove they‚Äôre signed up in good faith (financially meaningful payout size). 

I think this provides several ways to reach more citizens of the world. I think everyone with a smart phone could own some doge, even if they didn‚Äôt have funds or access to buy. I think that kind of adoption would lead to many many positive growth opportunities for doge and, counter-intuitively, would be good for coin value. 

I realize the enormous shitload of work it would be to accomplished, but let‚Äôs ignore that for now and poke holes in the general idea.

0.034,0.868,0.098,0.9348,"The Dogecoin Core 1.14.0 through 1.14.3 payouts have now been processed.

Many thanks to everyone who has contributed to these releases between January 2018 and February 2021; you‚Äôre all incredibly appreciated. These contributions enabled Dogecoin‚Äôs network to stay secure through times of relatively low public interest. 

Consistent with previous payout rounds, payouts are done in 2 tiers: major and minor, where each tier is defined by the amount and/or importance of code contributions that made it into the releases (i.e. have not been reversed.) 5 contributors had 10 or more contributions and one contribution ([#1676](https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin/pull/1676)) had such an impact (it fixed the performance of the entire Dogecoin network by a factor 20) that it was deemed of enough importance to be awarded a major tier payout.

Contributors that exclusively provided trivial fixes to code comments and documentation have been filtered out, to disincentivize commit spam.

As a result, six major contributors have each received 335,000 DOGE, and nine minor contributors have received 55,000 DOGE each. One payout has been requested to be delayed pending tax advice.

To preserve privacy, we will only list the addresses that payouts were made to.

0.039,0.904,0.057,0.6656,"So recently developers have been pushing for Segwit activation.  This would be a major release.  One that is contentious because it implies that we are following the failed path of BTC to scale without a hard fork.  Lightning has been ""in the works"" for over 4 years.  The fact is lighting totally does work, it just doesn't work in the way it is being promised, so it hasn't been launched fully.  See my post about why: [https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoindev/comments/mxmpic/why\_lightning\_network\_will\_probably\_never\_work\_as/](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoindev/comments/mxmpic/why_lightning_network_will_probably_never_work_as/)

So the thing is developers only get paid for major releases.  It has been 5 years since a major release.  There is roughly $6.5 million dollars in the dogecoin dev fund.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoindev/comments/mirqyb/the\_developer\_tipjar\_fund/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=ios\_app&utm\_name=iossmf](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoindev/comments/mirqyb/the_developer_tipjar_fund/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)

So there is a big incentive for devs to rush a major release of something that isn't needed nor wanted.  The community wants more TPS (transactions per second) and faster confirmations, none of which segwit will accomplish.  The community also wants reduction of the min transaction fee from 1 doge to 0.01 doge.  But that won't get the devs paid, so they are incentivized to make unnecessary changes instead.

So why don't we allow devs to get paid for minor releases?  Dogecoin really doesn't need too much work, and maintaining it should be a task worthy of getting paid for.  This would let the devs feel at ease that they can make small fixes the community is asking for and get paid, instead of pushing out something that no one asked for.

0.039,0.836,0.126,0.9246,"We've just released a new version of Dogecoin Core, which you can [download from Github](https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin/releases/tag/v1.14.3). This is a minor update that includes important performance improvements. It is a strongly recommended update for everyone.

This release can be installed over an existing 1.14 installation seamlessly, without the need for uninstallation, re-indexation or re-download. Simply shut down your running Dogecoin-QT or dogecoind, perform the installation and restart your node.

The two most important improvements are:

# Improve synchronization speed

Significantly improves the speed at which a node can upload blocks, by removing expensive integrity checks that were performed each time a block is sent to another node. When a block is received and during rescans of the locally stored blockchain, the checks are still performed.

# Reduce default mempool expiry time

Reduces the default time that transactions are cached in the mempool from 336 hours to 24 hours. This default setting can be overridden with the -mempoolexpiry parameter by individual node operators to a value (expressed in hours) that makes the most sense for the use cases the node serves.

DOGE in every pocket!
https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/pe2s7w/project_nidzer0_doge_in_every_pocket/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share

Duration: 
24hr

Goal: 
Observe performance of u/sodogetip (DOGE tip bot) within r/dogecoin.

Procedure: 
-Using the ""+/u/sodogetip 1 doge verify"" command; enable command as a reply as much as possible, as quickly as possible using a dedicated thread.
-Start with 300 DOGE. 
-Record and report all findings.

Results:
-Sucessful command exicution rate peaked at 9 commands per minute.
- Inital command error, ""1doge"" used instead of ""1 doge"". This error was found after ~20 tip attempts, these were deleted and updated avoiding duplication.
- Test required deviation from the control environment due to lack of user activity. Testing was moved to the general sub to interact with more users.
-Rate of successful transaction was dramatically impacted due to the large percentage of unregistered users.
- Found command does not work in chats.
Data:
- ~300 commands executed (rounded down from 312 for error allowance).
- 82 verification notifications.
- Approximate successful tip percentage 27%.
-Typical sucessful command to verification receipt time 40 seconds.

Observations:
-Inital usage instructions were difficult to locate; once found, usage was generally painless. 
-Large amount of users were suspicious of command activity; two users became offended after tipping occurred.
-No errors observed with command execution.
-3 instances of post limitation due to exceeding Reddit's activity limit.¬† 
-Initial deposit posted within a few minutes from source, subsequent deposit was successful after 15<>30 minutes.

Recommendations:
- +Balance command could show both current balance and balance after pending tips.
- Basic ""what is"" and ""how to"" explination on bot profile to make it more user friendly.
- Mention tip bot somewhere visible on sub to raise awareness and lower suspicions.
- Don't allow users to post additional tips that could cause pending tips to fault. (To avoid the awkward.)
- Condition resources to expedite expansion to multiple platforms, this would spread functionality and allow for a rapid increase in coin circulation.

Abstracts:
- The usefulness of the bot exceeds face value, aside from seeing who does/doesn't have an active bot wallet (if you see value in that), the act of posting a command summons the bot whom could then post confirming a successful tip. This could in theory triple the comment activity in the sub if every post/comment/reply was tipped. This, of course, would draw the attention of the entities watching activity.
- Wallets with 1 doge are unable to move said doge (due to the ""on chain"" transaction fee), on a large enough scale this would lower the volatility of DOGE in general. This would also allow the value of this coins to appriciate naturally leaving joy to those who remember it later.
- Although 1 DOGE = 1 DOGE, the acceptance value of 1 DOGE = ~0.273 DOGE based on this experiment. This corrilation was far closer to the market value (in USD) than I had originally anticipated. 

Follow-up hypothesis:
More tipping = Higher value
Given the magnitude of the subject, and the fact that the mods here were totally righteous in not banning me for spamming tips, I will plan to repeat this experiment in the near future to confirm my findings."

Launched, got address, transfered coins from exchange to it and never got synced because it is stuck at ""Connecting 0 peers"" which I believe old issue based on github issues and tricks with custom peers setup(which didn't work in my case).

To ""restore wallet"" I had to find debug console, read one-lined help and import key just to receive output ""NULL"" which I don't know is okay or not(and won't know until sync complete).
And now waiting for sync 7 years behind.

0.022,0.802,0.176,0.9962,"Hi!

A year ago I reserved some DOGE to tip exceptional, non-commercial content that furthers Dogecoin education. I was planning to tip those things on reddit that were so good that I could do 20 bigger tips, and make people have a bit more than just a beer or 2. Now... after a 100x price increase, I can suddenly tip a whole lot more content but I also don't have time to go over everything the communities create, because the sum of all people interacting with Dogecoin has grown at least as much as the price. Which is great by the way! Go shibes!!! Over the past year I've tried to get some help towards setting things up a couple of times but that hasn't worked out, so I'm doing this differently now:


**I'm looking to hire a web dev shibe for a small HTML job, so that I can run a website that describes the fund, shows the payouts and where people can nominate content to be curated.** I need a single responsive HTML page, without any framework code except bootstrap CSS or equivalent, just to-the-point HTML and images, and ***zero (!!!)*** javascript - I will personally take care of that, is faster than line-by-line review. 

[The mockup of what I envision it to be like can be found here](https://cloudflare-ipfs.com/ipfs/QmdgetnbCBhf1fa5q1MhRVQiWYdgLJmjAQxJfhzwTWEArm) - but this is just the general outline that I quickly mocked up, and I'm fully open to creativity; I'm good as long as the result looks ""professionally comic sans"" and I need it to be dark-mode friendly because otherwise I can't look at my own site. If you're interested, please DM me with some examples of (similar) work you have done in the past, and the amount of DOGE you'd like to charge for this. I'll award the job by Thursday.


^(PS: I know a lot of people are looking for ways to contribute to causes, but please note that this is a privately funded initiative - by me personally - and I will not accept any 3rd party contributions at this time, simply because I lack a legal framework for that, but I may change this in the future depending on the success of the fund.)"

After installation, a Dogecoin icon will appear in your extension bar (you can pin it):

\- Displaying the current price in color on the extension badge. Visible at a glance, this allows you to see the current trend (green: price is going up, red: it is going down). The price is updated every 5 minutes.

\- More details are displayed when clicking on the extension: precise price, evolution, opening/high/low price over the last 24 hours.

\- It is possible to configure wallet addresses (up to 2) to see the balance of your account.

\- Price management in USD or EUR via the configuration

The environmental impact of mining cryptocurrencies (and computation in general) is becoming significant.

A way around it could be migrating crypto mining on the moon using nuclear energy and sending the data through. Similarly, other heavy computation could be migrated there.

A business case could be attached to the proposition as this could also apply to other computation needs currently serviced on earth which already has a massive impact, and also act as a ""pilot"" to space colonisation

perhaps a bit of a ""moonshot"" idea but not inconceivable and can be elaborated"

I know that it took me a few days to get the task completed, checking in every few hours to see that little progress had been made. At times, I thought it had crashed on me. As it currently stands, the Dogecoin Core data folders stand at a respectful 49.1Gb. That's a pretty big download and so will take a while.

In order to speed things up, I created a torrent with the files needed to get you up to date. You can find the torrent, and instructions on how to install it below.

\*\*\*\*\*

**Torrent**: [Download here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/pk7xk80l8abm8uq/Dogecoin%20Blockchain%20Core%20-%2023%20February%202021.torrent?dl=0)  
**Updated**: 23 February 2021  
**Size**: 49.1Gb (37.7Gb Zipped)

\*\*\*\*\*

Make sure that you are running the latest version of Dogecoin Core. You can download the latest version from the [Dogecoin website](https://dogecoin.com). After you've installed it, we need to locate your Dogecoin Core data folder. The data folder location varies from system to system, but one easy way to find out is to go to ""*Help*"" > ""*Debug Console*"" and then go to the ""*Information*"" tab. The location of your Dogecoin Core data folder will be listed next to ""*datadir*"".

If you can't locate it using the method above, the default locations for the three most popular systems are as follows:

On a Linux system, it will be located at: \~/.dogecoin/  
On a Mac system, it will be located at: \~/Library/Application Support/Dogecoin  
On a Windows system, it will be located at: \\AppData\\Roaming\\Dogecoin

First things first. Make sure that you have shut down the Dogecoin Core application before you complete the following steps.

It's important that you backup and store a **copy** of the ""*wallet.dat*"" file, located within the data folder, in a safe and secure location. **If you lose this file, you will lose access to your coins**.

Once you've made a copy of the ""*wallet.dat*"" file, it's time to delete the current ""*block*"" and ""*chainstate*"" folders as well as the following, if they exist:

**Folders**  
blocks  
chainstate  
database

**Files**  
.lock  
banlist.dat  
fee\_estimates.dat  
mempool.dat  
peers.dat

**Do not touch any of the other folders and files.**

Move the downloaded ""*block*"" and ""*chainstate*"" files that you downloaded from the torrent into the Dogecoin Core data folder. If you've followed these instructions correctly, you should be able to run the Dogecoin Core application and it will sync in no time at all.

1) transaction code, like xlm, or xrp. Doge seems to be poised to be a kind of internet money, or at least it's growing in that direction so a code to identify the order, payee or whatnot might be handy. Could potentially make ready made web merchant stuff super simple.   


2)  Something to enhance cross chain functionality. I've heard you lovely devs bouncing those ideas around, and I also tend to believe cross-chain has a lot of future. It also helps keep the main net 'pure'? I have no idea what that looks like but a random thought. If that could be enhanced in some way I could see it being a plus.   


3) Someone else mentioned this before. Transaction fees. There's good odds doge will be more fiat valuable at some point, looking at the old chartey mcchart charts.

Why reinvent the wheel and have to compete when you can join forces with a project that has already put in the hard work of solving many of the challenges to being decentralized, inexpensive, scalable and secure?

It is possible to overlook such an option until you see the immediate advantages of this platform and how easy one could port Dogecoin over to another chain. 


Why Cardano?

Cardano utilizes Proof of stake, is scalable and ready to use now.  



Scalability -  Hydra -Set to come online in near future - Up to 1 million transactions per second.

‚ÄúSo with 1000 pools, Cardano could be theoretically able to scale up to 1 million TPS and the finality of transactions will be very fast. ‚Äú

https://cardanians-io.medium.com/hydra-cardano-scalability-solution-36b05ddc91cf




Native Token settlement -

Cardano will allow settlement of transactions using Cardano native tokens.  This could be very useful in minimizing fees and allowing DogeX only pools to exist. 

See ‚ÄòBabel Fee‚Äô

https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/02/25/babel-fees/




Transaction fee minimization- Dynamic transaction fees

Cardano to implement dynamic transaction fees, self-aware of price, at some point in the future. High utilization of the network combined with self aware fee adjustments, will work together to keep transaction fees as low a safely possible, dynamically, at all times. 



This is a solid blockchain that is ready to go now.




Enter - DogeX

asset1w303dxx7eatk9h3nsc9sg6fxqvh99sutwgvp62
Ôøº


To show how this could be done, I‚Äôve gone ahead and minted a Cardano Native Token and named it DogeX


Token stats 

Max supply 200 Billion Hard Capped

Why 2 billion?

Firstly, there are already 129 billion Doge and we want to air drop 1-1 and leave some for future uses.

Secondly, Cardano Native tokens can be broken down into .000001 increments.  

If we imagined .000001 DogeX being worth .01 USD. The total market cap at that point would be equivalent to 2 quadrillion USD.  Would we ever need more than this in our entire solar system? 




Conversion - Port process 

1-1 airdrop to all existing Doge holders with guaranteed token freeze/burn of the original Doge. 


All remaining DogeX tokens after Airdrop to be locked in a smart contract and released at a predefined, potentially fluctuating, (more on this later) rate.  My initial thought would be a release 1 million per day for next 192 years. Something like that. 


All proceeds of remaining DogeX go toward further goals of the project. 





Project goals - Doge to be come the currency of the Sun solar system.

Proceeds from remains 70 Billion could be used in 1 or both of 2 ways.


1.) Subsidized transaction fees  - Remaining DogeX tokens could be used to cover transaction fees likely via a variable inflationary type model. Possibly a zero cost to end user and or merchant model. 

e.g. the number of DogeX released to cover costs would be dynamic and fluctuate dependent on market conditions.

or

2.) Make DogeX interplanetary capable - Use funds to -

Create satellite constellation around the moon - minimum of 3 with each satellite running a Cardano relay node.

Create satellite constellation around Mars. Minimum 3 satellites each running a Cardano relay node.

Saltelite(s) (on earths solar orbit? Ask Elon) needed to allow communication with Mars while Mars is on other side of sun.

My fellow Shibes,

It‚Äôs been a wild ride so far but now our backs are up against the ropes. We‚Äôve had our ups and downs like all of the other crypto communities but, if anything, we‚Äôve proven that we are resilient‚Ä¶ and the potential futures look *so* bright; however, we **are** at a crossroads. We have in front of us the opportunity to come together and blaze a path forward through the challenges facing us as well as the broader crypto community and to represent something more.

Dogecoin related announcements by various organizations seem to be coming out at a faster rate, which is fantastic. The core developers and contributors are doing an amazing job, but there are some intense global pressures and a lot of us are simply looking for ways to contribute to the success of the coin. Unfortunately the barrier of entry in contributing to the Dogecoin core codebase is steep, but I believe that i‚Äôve found the way forward‚Ä¶ a viable pathway to running Dogecoin completely on ***SOLAR POWER***... and it all starts with this:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/b5trfaz6ez671.png?width=462&format=png&auto=webp&s=f26fffd79749244b58f52b4848373c7e233af26a

&#x200B;

The humble Raspberry Pi.

I‚Äôm proposing that we build an appliance based off of it.

&#x200B;

In a [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoindev/comments/nmfejy/alpha_release_dogecoin_on_kubernetes/) I announced the alpha release of a DogecoinD Docker Image and Kubernetes Helm Chart. The tech industry uses Kubernetes (k8s) to operate services in the cloud and is increasingly becoming the de facto standard upon which to develop and deploy your applications. When I started looking for ways to contribute I started with the simplest question: How do I run Dogecoin and work on it? The Dogecoin Core codebase ultimately gets compiled down into a single executable file that can run on your machine, but you have to run the file that maps to the type of machine you‚Äôre using. If you look in the ‚ÄúAssets‚Äù section of the [latest Dogecoin release](https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin/releases/tag/v1.14.3) you‚Äôll see that it‚Äôs available for a variety of platforms. I would venture to say that most people interact with the Dogecoin Core Wallet with the GUI interface on either Windows or OSX because it‚Äôs simple to use and we haven‚Äôt really had a need for something more complicated. Until now.

Admittedly, k8s is typically synonymous with large enterprises that run very complex workloads and historically it‚Äôs notorious for being a beast to set up, but the ecosystem of tooling these days has made it relatively simple to get started. Just keep in mind that Kubernetes is simply a way to package up software like Dogecoin to make it portable across systems and to help automate its lifecycle. It‚Äôs an orchestrator to be specific. So I decided to demonstrate how easy it can be by turning a Raspberry Pi into a Kubernetes powered Dogecoin FullNode. Thankfully, the devs have already been producing an aarch64 build, so I did a bunch of work and today i‚Äôm proud to announce **multi-arch support in the Dogecoin Docker image**. The \`aitherarchitect/dogecoin:latest\` image now supports both x86\_64 as well as aarch64/armv8 ***simultaneously*** and the entire initial setup from a fresh Raspebrry Pi has been boiled down to:

1. Flash MicroSD card with 64-bit version of Raspberry Pi OS for arm64/armv8/aarch64 (Official, but still a pre-release) - [http://downloads.raspberrypi.org/raspios\_arm64/images/raspios\_arm64-2021-05-28/2021-05-07-raspios-buster-arm64.zip](http://downloads.raspberrypi.org/raspios_arm64/images/raspios_arm64-2021-05-28/2021-05-07-raspios-buster-arm64.zip)[http://downloads.raspberrypi.org/raspios\_arm64/images/](http://downloads.raspberrypi.org/raspios_arm64/images/)
2. Immediately change default user‚Äôs pw and set up new user with sudo
3. Apt-get update && apt-get install -y git && Apt-get upgrade
4. Start SSH and set to start on boot (raspi-config cli tool > Interfaces submenu); Switch from console over to a remote SSH connection as desired
5. Enable container features: \`cgroup\_enable=cpuset cgroup\_memory=1 cgroup\_enable=memory >> /boot/cmdline.txt\`
6. Reboot
7. Install k3s: \`curl -sfL [https://get.k3s.io](https://get.k3s.io) | sh -\`
8. Install helm: \`curl [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helm/helm/master/scripts/get-helm-3](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helm/helm/master/scripts/get-helm-3) | bash\`
9. Configure cli tools to use k3s provided user config:\`export KUBECONFIG=/etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml && echo 'export KUBECONFIG=/etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml' >> \~/.bashrc\`
10. Install arkade simply because it‚Äôs amazing: \`curl -sLS [https://dl.get-arkade.dev](https://dl.get-arkade.dev) | sudo sh\`
11. git clone [https://github.com/Aither-Architect/dogecoin-helm.git](https://github.com/Aither-Architect/dogecoin-helm.git)
12. \`cd dogecoin-helm/; helm install dogecoin .\`

With those commands, your FullNode will start syncing with the network, provided that your local network firewall settings allow the communication.  I shall call it‚Ä¶ the Dogeberry Pi! When I got all of that working I couldn‚Äôt help but get a chuckle from the seeming insanity of packing all of this high tech into what most people regard as a hobby board, but I bought a Raspberry Pi 4 Model B with 8 GiB of RAM; it‚Äôs a respectably beefy little thing that (thanks to the armv8 architecture in the Pi 4‚Äôs) is now capable of training Machine Learning models and neural networks. Looking at the resource usage, a fully synced and idle node consumes approximately \~1GiB of RAM and the cpu is mostly idle:

So one could very reasonably assume that we generally have about 6 GiB to work with on the side and treat this as both a dual purpose Dogeberry Pi node as well as a home software development server. Personally, i‚Äôve been warming up to the idea of installing [OpenHAB](https://www.openhab.org/) on it to tie all of my smarthome devices together. All of this capability in such a small device that can be powered on \~10  watts under load is pretty amazing.

run this thing completely off of solar power! Yes, that Dogeberry Pi is completely off-grid save for the WiFi that it‚Äôs consuming. The PiJuice HAT made it so easy to set this up, you just plug the thing in and go for the most part. The solar panel array I bought is honestly way overkill for this Proof of Concept, as they‚Äôre rated at 100 Watts. I went oversized because I live in Austin, TX and ERCOT isn‚Äôt exactly winning any awards lately‚Ä¶

So let me back up a bit‚Ä¶ i‚Äôm running the Dogecoin Core software on a Raspberry Pi 4B, **COMPLETELY POWERED BY THE G-DANG SUN** with power to spare. I call that a win!

Before we go further, I can already hear some of you: ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs cute and all, Sean, but a Raspberry Pi doesn‚Äôt have a shot in hell stacked up against ASIC mining rigs‚Äù. Yes, that‚Äôs true‚Ä¶ well sort of  ;) Let‚Äôs unpack that a bit.

For any given computer running Dogecoin, it‚Äôs doing two things:

1. Securing the network by validating and propagating transactions
2. Mining

With a Proof of Work model, the Pi has *zero* chances on the mining front when stacked up against GPUS and ASICs, i‚Äôll give you that. The thing is, though, that both functions are necessary and the beautiful part is that every solar powered Dogeberry Pi out there can be treated as a sort of carbon offset when considering the Dogecoin network as a whole and towards that goal of ‚Äúusing less than 1% the energy of Bitcoin‚Äù.

When it comes to mining from the Dogeberry Pi, we have well.. work.. to do. Proof of Work and Proof of Stake have gotten us this far so we can‚Äôt knock on them too hard but their shortcomings are painfully clear for where we are in our global crypto journey. The dynamics of centralization of wealth in both systems leaves something to be desired and locks the common people out. The barrier of entry into Proof of Stake IS existing wealth, so that means there‚Äôs almost no hope for someone starting from scratch. Now on to Proof of Work and the electricity consumption‚Ä¶ here we go. We are using so much electricity because of the sheer amount of computation being done (to get the duh, no-brainer out of the way), but what is that computation actually doing? Taking a look further, we are more or less just exploring a solution space by randomly guessing. In other words, when you‚Äôre trying to mine for rewards what you‚Äôre actually doing is playing a fancy-pants version of Battleship where you‚Äôre trying to hit a target by process of elimination. You‚Äôre playing against a computer opponent and everyone else is playing against their own. Whoever beats their opponent first, wins. Now what if you started playing the game at 10x the speed of all of the other humans playing? This is why people invest in ASIC rigs for mining, to simply play the game *faster.* But to what end? Sure, somebody gets a reward, but the game/computation itself is otherwise useless and everyone else simply wasted electricity in the attempt. If we‚Äôre going to use up computation (and thus electricity), its use should be maximized or at the very least *useful*. Enter the aptly named system, Proof of Useful Work:

[https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.09244v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.09244v1)

&#x200B;

This gem of a paper as an alternative to the traditional Proof of Work was brought to my attention by u/Odysseus2202. I have to admit that at first I brushed it off because I didn‚Äôt know too much about the nuts and bolts of the proof systems in crypto at the time but I really don‚Äôt like dismissing things out of hand. So I sat down over the course of several nights to study, consumed the topics as best I could to get oriented with the landscape as well as some of the nuance, and made a concerted effort to understand what the paper was suggesting. I‚Äôm so glad that I did because the ideas presented shook my soul. It offers something groundbreaking and revolutionary for crypto yet the premise is so simple:

If the river is flowing -anyway- let‚Äôs put a water wheel on it to put that energy to work.

&#x200B;

This brings about a system that promotes: **Honest Pay for Honest Work**

Organizations and individual experimenters require huge amounts of computing power to train Machine Learning models and Neural Nets and they pay HEFTY sums to get it. The Dogecoin network is one big global pool of compute power. Let‚Äôs sell that compute power to organizations and the reward for doing honest, useful work is some Dogecoin. We would need to expose an API and customer/utility portal of some sort, but that‚Äôs a road well trodden. This idea of crowd-sourced distributed compute pools is nothing new as there is precedence with the SETI program, Folding@Home, NiceHash, etc. In this model, **EVERYONE** that participates in a batch of useful work would get a Dogecoin payout proportional to the amount of computing power offered to the compute job.

Before I got too excited I wanted to run this paper by some friends in Data Science to get their thoughts on the viability of this paradigm. I reached out to Rob Chong and Deepak Shah, a Director of Data Science and a Principal Data Scientist, respectively. While they did raise some questions related to the finer points of data flows while training models (I kind of went cross-eyed at this part of the phone conversation, I can‚Äôt lie), they each gave a thumbs up on calling it a viable pathway. Let‚Äôs debate the merits of this paper together.

A supremely critical point to bring up is that this model could potentially invalidate the usage of ASICs ***altogether*** due to the nature of the work at the macro scale being very general and unknown in advance. This levels the playing field for the common folk.

Switching to Proof of Useful Work means that the Dogeberry Pi appliance could then legitimately become an entry-level mining rig and thus becomes a passive source of income by selling computing power to organizations; the operator/maintainer of the Dogeberry Pi appliance then only needs to worry about keeping the rig online and in good working order to earn a passive income. The payout price would be comprised of numerous factors like the availability of compute pools with respect to demand, the capability of the underlying hardware offered, the current price of Dogecoin at the time, etc. Since the compute power would be crowd-sourced and (ideally) solar, I think it could be reasonable to target a cost of compute that is 50% of the cost of major cloud compute like AWS. Keeping the price point a proportion of cloud compute costs incentivizes organizations to prefer the Dogecoin Compute Network over others. The economics of this should work out such that it‚Äôs feasible to run this with a single Dogeberry Pi node and earn an income, or go all in on a massive solar compute farm as a business. Ultimately what I would love to see is that we make running a FullNode profitable enough that someone from an affluent country would want to do it. If we can do that, then the possibility exists to raise entire families out of poverty in the less affluent countries (of course assuming training volume). The barrier of entry into a new socioeconomic bracket then becomes

* Raspberry Pi
* Power Management Module w/ Battery
* Solar Panel
* Internet connection and bandwidth
* The willpower to learn and the commitment to stick to it

There are some tradeoffs, of course. Yes, the training process for ML models would be slower than GPU based clusters that are not based on this federated model of training. It‚Äôs not meant to be a Model S Plaid; it‚Äôs more like the commuter train. It‚Äôs about Economy vs. Performance. Each individual unit isn‚Äôt a screaming machine, but if we have thousands of them acting in unison, then we have something formidable. This paradigm brings several layers of utility to Dogecoin, creates a forcing function towards adoption, and creates transaction volume. Building this fleet of Dogeberry Pi‚Äôs could be the first major step toward a more harmonious future for crypto.

**A note here for a follow up post**: Building this out means that there will be more levers in the codebase to pull that can have serious economic consequences. We should look into implementing a governance token to start a DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) for voting rights over key decisions. Governance tokens could be earned by staking coins to a Liquidity Pool (thus paving the way for some advanced DeFi applications) and earning/farming an intermediary utility token. The intermediary token could be farmed and used to buy more Dogecoin or it could be minted into the governance/voting token (non-transferrable).

**Market opportunities people could use to generate income from a Dogeberry Pi world:**

* Dogecoin branded and custom 3D printed Raspberry Pi cases -- The picture of my solar Dogeberry Pi makes me a little sad because adding the PiJuice HAT prevents me from using the case it came with. Also, I did have a problem with cooling for the POC I did because it had no protection from the sun or any way to actively move air over the heatsinks. I would be willing to pay someone handsomely for a 3D printed theme mashup of Dogecoin and Pirates of the Caribbean
* Professional Services and Support offerings
* Training courses
* Building tooling for easier management
* Gamification around producing solar power for the Dogeberry Pi. Maybe a points/ranking system
* I‚Äôve never had my hands on a Tesla PowerWall. Are there any opportunities for a tight integration between that Dogeberry Pi and the wall unit?

## 

## The Ask

This proposal is complex and the most elegant way to implement this paradigm is on the Dogecoin blockchain itself. It will take time for all of us to discuss Proof of Useful Work and come to a consensus. In the meantime, I have a way to produce the same effect without having to modify Dogecoin Core itself. Running Kubernetes on all of the Dogeberries allows us to tie all of them together into one big pool of compute. If we put an API and a payment portal in front of the fleet then we have a product where companies can pay fiat currency to use compute and the fiat currency is automatically converted to Dogecoin for payout to pool participants.

I believe that I can build this with the support of the community. In my previous posts, I invoke the idea of ‚Äúwe at Aither‚Äù but to be honest, Aither is still a company of 1 --myself-- and it‚Äôs a company on paper as there is zero revenue at the moment; i‚Äôm still building my prototype. The truth‚Ä¶ is that i‚Äôm just a regular guy. I work a day job to pay the bills‚Ä¶ yet also, I am that proverbial guy in his garage building things, willing to challenge the status quo. Through hard work, a bit of luck, the support of loved ones, and the grace of god I was able to overcome some economic boundaries and help lift my family into the middle class; since then i‚Äôve made it my mission to extend that hope to as many people as I possibly can. People deserve to live life with dignity and self respect. They shouldn‚Äôt have to choose between buying medication to avert some debilitating symptoms or putting food on the table for their children or grandchildren; affordable healthcare is a whole ball of wax unto itself. Putting a good, honest 40 hours of work in per week should guarantee a livable life and there should be no need to get a second or third job just to barely make it over the finish line month to month. Nevermind the fact that one might be one major car breakdown away from losing those jobs and having their whole life come collapsing down upon them. This is the reason I founded Aither, hope for a better future for all of us.

Dogecoin and cryptocurrency in general is a way to break free from aspects of this vicious cycle that dominate so many of us across the world. It can help us start correcting our financial systems and restore power back to the people. This is why I am asking for your financial support in order to quit my day job and develop this pathway full-time. I need a runway in terms of funding so that I can put food on the table for my family while I dedicate my full work-week to the dogecoin community as well as take care of things like:

* Cloud Infrastructure costs for development
* Security
* Hiring contractors for software engineering and to speed up project deliverables
* Security
* Legal analysis
* Security

I was able to put all of this together in a couple months as I scratched time away from my job and family duties. Just imagine if I could dedicate full, consistent time to this endeavor. If any of my work that i‚Äôve presented here is valuable to you or if you would like to support the initiative, please consider donating:

I've thought about how the rich run the system and they do it by making sure to buy goods & services from their inner circle. They help each other first and that way the money stays with them and we fight for doge scraps. Wow much sad such unfair

We should be helping shibes by looking to buy goods & services we need from them using doge or at least 20-30% doge at the start. That way shibes can earn doge and then spend the doge buying something from other shibes. This way nobody paperhands and everything is wow. 

I mean if you're going to buy something anyway why not buy it from a shibe instead of buying it from corpo XYZ that makes workers pee in coffee mugs.

Most shibes would probably be small business owners that got hit heavily by the pandemic so in the spirit of doge we're giving them a helping paw.

So why aren't we doing this? 

Well doge is still relatively niche and it's difficult to find other shibes. I know there's online marketplaces for doge & other crypto, but most of it is just digital content. We need to be able to buy doge food with doge to be taken seriously.

Introducing the actual idea:

We make a website where shibes that sell goods & services can advertise and have like a mini profile and a link to their store or a contact form or something. Other shibes can then search by products and location to find nearby shibes and buy what they need from there. 

So basically it's like an advertisement board for doge hodlers. I don't think we need to bother with facilitating the transactions ourselves. It's going to be free and run on donations. We can name it dogeboard.moon or something.

Let me know if you'd be interested in helping out with this. I'm too dumb to know how to code all of it. This is going to be charity work and I'll fund the initial running and setup costs myself."

With the fee reduction in the works doge is getting closer to being a competitor with credit card companies.  And some people are spending doge using their coinbase credit card.  Which is great, but it's not what I want from crypto.

Right now when I use my credit card I fill out a customer profile.  So if, in a given day, I donate to wikileaks, buy some bondage gear and purchase a book entitled ""how to make bombs at home"" that all goes into a consumer profile that will be shared with the kind and moral people who run intelligence agencies as well as 'partner' corporations who, I am assured, only have my best interests at heart.

I'd like to avoid the whole consumer profile business altogether.  I should be able to use electronic currency the way I use paper currency.

I've compiled this mostly from my own knowledge and some previous versions of this FAQ I have released, but also I also included some new ideas suggested by others.

Almost all these questions have their origins in misinformation deliberately spread about Dogecoin, hence why I call it the DOGE[FUD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear,_uncertainty,_and_doubt) FAQ. However, often they're raised by people who are sincere but have been exposed to that misinformation, rather than by people deliberately trying to sabotage Dogecoin.

You're welcome to link people to this post, or to copy-paste sections from here when communicating with people, or to adapt the content below for your own purposes.

**Q: Does DOGE have a fixed supply? Does DOGE have a ‚Äúcap‚Äù? Does DOGE have a ‚Äúhard cap‚Äù?**  
A: 
Yes, DOGE has a fixed supply of 10,000 coins per block. 
Yes, there is a ‚Äúcap‚Äù on how many DOGE will exist at any given time. 
No, DOGE does not have a ‚Äúhard cap‚Äù because there will never be a day when no more DOGE is issued.

Bitcoin does have a hard cap, which means its supply increase (""inflation"") will go to 0% after 2140. DOGE‚Äôs supply increase is 3.94% in 2021 and it falls every year and over a very long period of time will eventually get arbitrarily low (e.g. 0.00000000000000000001%) but will never reach exactly 0%.

Three of the best well-known cryptocurrencies have selected different solutions  
- Bitcoin has a fixed supply, and a hard cap.  
- Dogecoin has a fixed supply, but no hard cap.  
- Ethereum has an unfixed supply, and no hard cap.  

Nobody knows which solution is best, but we think it is smart to keep minting some coins each year, because some coins are always lost from circulation, and we want to encourage people to spend coins and not hoard them.

**Q: Does this mean ‚Äúunlimited‚Äù or ‚Äúinfinite‚Äù DOGE can exist at any time?**  
A: No. Here we hand over to Dogecoin Developer /u/patricklodder, who writes

> The fallacy in the ""unlimited coin theory"" is this:
> 
> - Time is unlimited
> - Dogecoin issues a predefined amount of new coin over time
> - Therefore, there are unlimited coins.
> 
> This is correct. But now:
> 
> - At any point in time, the value of dogecoin will drop, because there are unlimited coins.
> 
> This is false, because at any point in time, there is still a limit to the amount of DOGE. Only if you look over infinite time, is there infinite DOGE.

Imagine you make $30 per hour at a 9am-5pm job. If someone asks you how much money you make, would you say ‚ÄúI actually make infinite dollars, because if you assume I live forever I would never stop making money‚Äù? No, you would say ‚ÄúI make $30 an hour‚Äù or ‚ÄúI make $62,000 per year‚Äù. 

Similarly, if someone asks about DOGE 'inflation', you should say ‚ÄúDoge supply increase is currently 3.94% per year, and it gets lower every year‚Äù. 

**Q: I heard that 10,000 DOGE are minted every minute. Isn‚Äôt that a lot of DOGE?**  
A: At first it sounds like a big number, given Bitcoin only mints 96,162 Bitcoins per year. But did you know Bitcoin minted 96,162,000,000,000 Satoshis in 2020? Changing the base unit can make a dramatic shift in how large the supply increase seems to be. However, it only makes sense to consider the percentage supply increase per year. The raw units do not allow any basis for comparison between coins, because every crypto denominates their coins differently.

**Q: OK, if we should consider percentage supply increase, what is DOGE‚Äôs percentage supply increase?**  
A: Here is the total number of Dogecoins available at the end of each year of its existence, and the percentage change year on year. 

[End 2013](https://coinmarketcap.com/historical/20131231/): 18,211,323,904 Dogecoins in circulation  
[End 2014](https://coinmarketcap.com/historical/20141231/): 97,204,400,153 (+434.8% increase in supply)  
[End 2015](https://coinmarketcap.com/historical/20151231/): 102,460,278,024 (+5.41% increase in supply)  
[End 2016](https://coinmarketcap.com/historical/20161231/): 107,529,653,033 (+4.95% increase in supply)  
[End 2017](https://coinmarketcap.com/historical/20171231/): 112,578,744,538 (+4.70% increase in supply)  
[End 2018](https://coinmarketcap.com/historical/20181231/): 117,640,040,831 (+4.50% increase in supply)  
[End 2019](https://coinmarketcap.com/historical/20191231/): 122,701,414,426 (+4.30% increase in supply)  
[End 2020](https://coinmarketcap.com/historical/20201231/): 127,748,316,518 (+4.11% increase in supply)  

There is estimated to be 3.94% supply increase in 2021. 2022 will be even lower, and 2023 lower still, and so on forever. 

**Q: Will supply increase cause the DOGE price in USD to fall?**  
A: Even in the early years when DOGE‚Äôs supply increase was higher its price in USD managed to rise over time. If DOGE managed to rise in 2018 with a supply increase of 4.50% there is no reason why it can‚Äôt rise in 2021 with  a supply increase of 3.94%, especially because there is now a lot more interest in DOGE. 

**Q: How does DOGE‚Äôs supply increase compare to Bitcoin‚Äôs?**  
A: It is quite similar for the early years.  

2020 was the 8th year of Dogecoin‚Äôs life, and DOGE had 4.11% supply increase during 2020.  
2016 was the 8th year of Bitcoin‚Äôs life, and Bitcoin had 6.95% supply increase during 2016.  

You can easily verify this yourself through simple calculations made on the coinmarketcap pages for 2015 and 2016 listed above.

The main difference with Bitcoin is that DOGE‚Äôs supply increase never gets to exactly 0%, and it declines at a more steady pace. Again, we think this is smart because we want to encourage people to spend coins instead of hoarding them.

**Q: Is a big DOGE whale who can crash the price?**  
A: No - the DOGE ‚Äúwhale‚Äù isn‚Äôt actually a whale but rather an exchange. It belongs to Robinhood (source: https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-17/cryptocurrency-sleuths-point-to-robinhood-as-dogecoin-whale). 

Although we would prefer that people were out there spending their DOGE instead of holding it on an exchange, it is not a bad thing that a very large number of people on Robinhood each have a small amount of coin. We want DOGE to be spread out as much as possible, so that everyone has a stake in our currency.

**Q: Is DOGE going to die?**  
A: Short answer: What is DOGE may never die.

Long answer: DOGE has been around since 2013 and has thrived when thousands of other cryptocurrencies have faded. Here‚Äôs the first day Dogecoin was listed on CoinMarketCap: https://coinmarketcap.com/historical/20131215. Do you see many other names you recognize?

**Q: What is going to happen to the DOGE price in USD?**  
A: We haven‚Äôt got a clue, and neither does anyone else. All we know is that √ê1 is going to stay √ê1."

0.011,0.824,0.165,0.9951,"It was hard for people to accept merged mining of doge with litecoin initially because it felt like we were loosing control of our coin.  I wasn't around back then but it seems like this was a common sentiment and makes sense to me.

What if there was a different possibility for merged mining, one that gives a coin still a sense of uniqueness and independence while also allowing for merged mining?

My proposition is something I will term asymmetric or asymmetrical merged mining.  Basically a coin can be merge mined, but only at say 2/3 the normal hashrate.  What this would mean is that if you were already mining litecoin then for sure you would want an additional 2/3 of hashpower going to another coin reward for free.  But if you were a true believer in doge, you would mine doge at full strength and then merge mine litecoin at 2/3 power.

So anyway if this is technically possible to code at this point, I think it would be a perfect solution to the murky question of whether merged mining is always the best choice for a coin to make.

A downside of course would be that you are giving up useful hashpower to secure the network, basically for nothing in return in 100/66 merged mining rather than 100/100.  But my response to that is currently the only option is 100/100 or 100/0.  This option would give more granularity for a decision rather than a binary decision.  Also it would incentivize devs in both coins to open up merged mining for eachother, instead of a one sided thing like with litecoin and doge where you can only mine primarily on litecoin and also merge mine on doge but not the other way around.  The asymmetric nature would make both dev teams want to open up merged mining for eachother on their own blockchains allowing much more independence for each coin.

Forgive if this has been posted previously and I didn't find it ...

With Dogecoin having a need for more Full Nodes, and Full Nodes being something that can be set up on VMs, I was wondering if it might be worth trying to fund the creation of as many as we can crowdfund.

I haven't done any research to see how much it might cost to host a full node VM, and I would be very interested in knowing if there's some way to get a rough count of how many would help us today, and as we grow - i.e., so we could figure out how to get going cost-wise, and plan for the future.

As it seems a difficult ask to get noobs to install Dogecoin Core and set up a Full Node, and we seem to really be in need of more Full Nodes, I thought this might be one way?

In summary, I think it might be awesome to figure out:

* what's a minimum number of full nodes that would benefit us now
* how much does hosting one full node on a vm cost
* plan for scale
* get Doge Community Crowdfunding

0.025,0.926,0.049,0.5487,"A new version of Dogecoin Core, v1.14.4, has been released and can be downloaded from the Github [release page](https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin/releases/tag/v1.14.4). This is a minor update that includes important performance improvements and prepares the network for lower recommended fees, per the [fee policy change proposal](https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin/discussions/2347). It is a recommended update for all shibes.

This release can be installed over an existing 1.14 installation seamlessly, without the need for uninstallation, re-indexation or re-download. Simply shut down your running Dogecoin-QT or dogecoind, perform the installation and restart your node.

Most important changes are:

**Enabling Future Fee Reductions**

Prepares the network for a reduction of the recommended fees by reducing the default fee requirement 1000x for transaction relay and 100x for mining. At the same time it increases freedom for miner, wallet and node operators to agree on fees regardless of defaults coded into the Dogecoin Core software by solidifying fine-grained controls for operators to deviate from built-in defaults.

This realizes **the first part of a two-stage update** to lower the fee recommendation - a followup release will implement the lower fee recommendation, once the network has adapted to the relay defaults introduced with this version of Dogecoin Core.

**Synchronization Improvements**

Removes a bug in the network layer where a 1.14 node would open many parallel requests for headers to its peers, increasing the total data transferred during initial block download up to 50 times the required data, per peer, unnecessarily. As a result, synchronization time has been reduced by around 2.5 times.

I want to share something for the community: I made today an HTML/pure CSS animated background.

Here is the link to the codepen *(Wait for it, or you'll miss the rocket!)*: https://codepen.io/zedsdev/pen/NWdjOVY

You can use it anywhere, on websites, videos, gifs... It is free to use, you can modify it, upgrade it, even sell it (but I'll be very sad)

If you're using it, feel free to link your project in comments. I'll be happy to see what you've done with it :)

( I think, been doing research on my own for some time now ) I read that dogecoins block reward is 10,000 doge coins and that the block time is 1 minute. This means ( I assume ) that its very fast to mine, and the reward is extremely big. Compared to for example litecoins 14(24?) block reward with an increasingly higher block time as-well. So my question is, with all the hype, all the people investing into doge coin, what stops the devs from making the block time higher, or making the block reward lower. Wouldn't that increase the value, and lower the amount of dogecoins out in the market, or no?

I know that Teslas have Nvidia chips in them, would it be possible to use those chips to mine the Scrypt algorithm while the car is parked?  I'm sure it wouldn't be as profitable as an ASIC but it would help further decentralize the network, incentivize people to buy Teslas (the car helps pay for itself), and the feature could even be set to only work if the car was charged or is connected to a ""green"" source of electricity.

Another thought that I had is some kind of incentive for miners to buy a Tesla solar roof and/or Powerwall.  This would have the same benefits and incentives as mining in the cars (offsetting equipment cost, ""green"" energy).  This could come in the form of either a rebate on purchasing the equipment if it's paid for in Doge, or some kind of discount or exclusive offer on the ASIC miners themselves if you own a solar roof or Powerwall.  Perhaps Tesla or another one of Elon's companies like SpaceX could even start producing Scrypt ASIC miners optimized for Dogecoin mining.  I would definitely buy one!

We cannot just sit here and wait for Papa Musk to drop the next tweet about DOGECOIN.

It was meant to incorporate DOGECOIN in the DeFI ecosystem and help ETHEREUM with its number one issue: transaction speed.

However, because of lack of funding and the first cryptowinter, they put the project on hold.

Let's bring it back and help get THE PEOPLE'S CRYPTO closer to the moon.

0.035,0.801,0.165,0.9981,"Good day to the devs, the community, Elon, Gene, Snoop and any other celebrity investors. I'm here today to talk to you about THE BIG PICTURE related to CC and Doge in particular. Today we shall have adult conversations about monetary systems, particularly the current one we are using and the role of CC and Dogecoin as it related to the future of humanity and what the role of Dogecoin and CC in general can do and be for humanity . At the core of this is a complex yet simple quandary, the creation of currency for humanity to use as a means of exchange and a store of wealth without the creation process being corrupted, as it is now.  The following bullet points are pertinent to the following conversation and statements and need to be addressed individually within the context of Dogecoin and how it can ""fix"" existing problems.

1. Understanding the current central banking systems . ie understanding the ""carny"" ""usury"" ""authority"" scam that it is. Understanding the private ownership of the ""rights to create currency""  ""government backed"" currency and just what going on here in so far as the creation process is concerned 
2. Understanding the political ramifications of the present system of currency creation as it pertains to taxation and social services for said populations under the rule of these monetary systems, as well as how the elimination of current systems would effect the current political systems, both in the USA and the globe in general
3. How Dogecoin can be used to ""take back"" the power of currency creation from the present group of criminals not only in the USA but globally and to give that back to the people and allow for an even playing field for all in their pursuit of happiness.
4. The absolute importance of the coin count being ""infinity"" 
5. the absolute importance of Dogecoin being valued in itself and the start of the process of weening ourselves off central bank created currency  and to truly start the process of 1 Doge = 1 Doge
6. the reality that Dogecoin could be the opportunity to do what Bitcoin was supposed to do...., or what the early adopters had hoped for,get rid of central banking and fraudulent taxation that is being extracted under the guise of paying for ""social services"" and ""government"" And how Dogecoin can have realistic social service costs factored into the creation process in order to serve humanity, not to parasitically suck us dry.
7. The reality is that a ""proper, well functioning honest, global monetary system has the ability to 1. stop war, 2. promote resource sharing instead of hoarding 3. to both act locally but also positively effect global changes for all 4. shift humanities focus onto real problem solving and quality of life issues for all. Conserve and preserve the natural environment through innovative mind share related to tackling some of the larger problems facing the world today.

I ask you to not think to yourself, how much is my Dogecoin worth, but to think of it's increasing value as ""we're"" that much closer to ending this charade without resorting to violence.

This BIG PICTURE due diligence conversation will happen over several days and several posts where I will go over the bullet points individually in order to give each one the detailed conversation that it requires and will encourage others to participate in brainstorming sessions as the topics unfold, and I welcome tangent thoughts and conversations and will say that anything goes as long as its about trying to turn Doge coin into the peoples currency and to ween ourselves off central bank money.

I am sure you knew about Bitpay adopting Dogecoin before we did, but I believe this is one of the biggest positive news to come to Doge in the past weeks, also considering that Bitpay is extremely selective in their choice of cryptos (Bitcoin and Eth are the only non stable coins, I believe).

Do you think it would make sense to somehow pinpoint the news to our users, maybe also through the Twitter channel?

I have used BitPay in clients websites in the past, and they have plugins ready for Wordpress (through Woocommerce), Magento, and more. This means two of the biggest e-commerce platforms have already a fool proof, secure implementation to allow Dogecoin payments, backed by a large company.

That way you use far less energy, you can mine any other coins or do folding@home rest of the time and you can't borrow and stake a ton of coins and take over the network. And mining uses far less energy. It's a proof-by-having-a-rig instead of proof-by-emitting-CO2 or proof-by-owning-lots-of-doge-at-certain-point-in-time. If you borrowed Monero's CPU proof-of-work, and made voting power be provable say for mining 0.5min out of several hours, anybody with a a PC or a laptop could easily participate in securing the network.

Now that I'm past IBD, Dogecoin Core is generally doing an ok job saturating my upstream bandwidth: as measured with

```sh
nettop -p $(pgrep Dogecoin-Qt) -J bytes_out -d
```

the `bytes_out` of the process is typically 400-600 KiB/s (cf. Transmission which could sustain 500-700 KB/s).

I have what are probably basic questions about Dogecoin's protocol:

1. Is it true && by design that I'm not sending blocks to needy peers while I'm syncing my own chain? If so, why? Feels maybe motivated by some subtle (or not) security concern, perhaps.
2. In general, should I expect Dogecoin Core to saturate my upstream bandwidth (O(5 to 6 Mbps)) when run with default options? Assuming there's ample CPU/memory available for it to claim.

0,0.903,0.097,0.9485,"With every major release, we rebuild Dogecoin on top of the Bitcoin Core code and this goes through 4 phases:

* Port all the protocol changes that make up the DOGE asset and the Dogecoin chain security. This roughly consists of:
  1. The chain and asset identifiers, blocktime, issuance/subsidy and scrypt 
  1. Digishield and other feature enablement
  1. AuxPoW
* Set up softforks for enablement of new protocol/consensus functionality
* Brand everything as Dogecoin (UI and help texts)
* Add Dogecoin specific wallet features such as the paper wallet generator

Currently the first two items of phase 1 are done, and only AuxPoW remains to close off this phase. We have draft code for this in [https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin/pull/1974](https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin/pull/1974), and we‚Äôll be breaking that huge pull request down into smaller requests which can be meaningfully reviewed. Once this is done, we can move on to enable new functionality.

Once all of these are in, we‚Äôll then be looking at mining on 1.21, and after that branding (as in, making it look like Dogecoin) will come in, along with UI changes. You can track this work on the [project board](https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin/projects/4).

This could be beneficial in a lot of ways, this app could act as a dogewallet or link to a dogewallet allowing the user to regularly purchase dogecoin in increments, as well as link to other apps that connect doge holders with companies that accept doge as payment, so that it in a way becomes its own ‚Äúbank account‚Äù for lack of a better term.

Some say ""joke"", I say that's the beauty of it when we live in these days and times.

It's ironic at the amount of moments in history were mistakes or jokes that created a fundamental baseline in our lives now. My question to anyone that is listening/reading... how can a simple man with heart and soul for doge do more than simply posting about it, critiquing the critics, or telling the people I know about it in hopes they invest into the future.

0.054,0.776,0.17,0.9663,"Easy. You make the block speed 10x faster, and you reduce fees 10x. This will keep the same amount of fees per minute or hour or day. You would also need to reduce the block reward by 10x in order to keep the same block rewards per day (aka inflation rate). This is how you make dogecoin a perfect spending currency. tx speed will be incredibly fast, tx fee will be incredibly low, and nothing changes for the miners. Only issue is the latency from the miner to the network would need to be fairly high to sustain this kind of block speed, but we are in a world where most people are playing FPS games that require milisecond delays to be playable, so I think we are golden on that.. Also starlink is a perfect solution to increasing latency in rural or slow internet areas if you want to mine the best currency in the world."

**2021** *-Scale 2x current-*

1. Reduce min tx fees to below 1 cent in 1.14.4 update. Elon suggests 100x reduction, I suggest 200x (which would put us at half a cent when we hit $1)
2. Once fee is reduced, monitor blocksize for 3 months. See if the blocksize increases significantly and we have any spam issues. I anticipate blocksize will not change significantly and there will be no spam issues. Continue to address current node syncing issues.
3. If blocksize is stable, implement segwit and double max blocksize to 2mb at the same time in 1.21 update.

**2022** *-Scale 8x current-*

1. Address any issues with segwit and monitor that blocksize is stable.  Finish up addressing node syncing issues.
2. Once everything is stable, reduce blocktime by one-half to 30 seconds. Monitor syncing and orphan rate. Orphan rate should always stay below 10%.
3. Once everything is stable double blocksize again (to 4mb). Monitor for spam and adjust min tx fee accordingly. Implement lightning code as needed.

**2023** *-Scale 16x current-*

1. Once everything is stable reduce blocktime by one-half to 15 seconds. Monitor syncing and orphan rate.

**2024** *-Scale 40x current-*

1. Once everything is stable Increase max blocksize to 10mb (10x bitcoin and our current blocksize). Adjust min tx fee as needed to keep blockchain growth under control and in-line with our recommended full node specifications \*.

**Beyond** *-Scale potentially 100x + current-*

1. As orphan rate approaches 5% consider future incremental blocktime decreases to eventually 6-7 seconds or faster depending on how we can stay synced and maintain orphan rate below 10%.
2. If we get to the point that block space is limited and fees are increasing, consider increasing max blocksize while keeping to parameters of node syncing and orphan rate.

\***Notes:**

* Of course we will need to change block reward every time blocktime is updated to maintain a constant emission of 10,000 coins per minute.
* We need to develop metrics and measures for orphan rate and syncing rate.
* We need to develop suggested specifications for full nodes and required specifications for full nodes. RAM, processor speed/cores, and storage space should be specified. We need to consider that each full node does the job of the entire paypal server farm and therefore a rudimentary server will be required if we progress beyond a hobby project. In light of this we need to make running a ""pruning node"" easily selected from the core wallet.
* If energy usage / asic unavailability due to chip shortage becomes a serious issue and is causing potential centralization, consider change of PoW algorithm to [ProgPoW](https://github.com/ifdefelse/ProgPOW) which is a well developed ASIC resistant GPU friendly hashing algorithm. If energy use or GPU availability becomes a major concern, there is always the CPU algo [Yespower](https://github.com/openwall/yespower).
* If Proof of Work proves way too slow or other serious problems with PoW arise (in other words; ""if all else fails""), we can consider a change to PoS or Proof of Rest [\#1942](https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin/issues/1942) or some other solution. Or PoS as a layer 2 [\#1924](https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin/issues/1924).
* We should also do research into how our nodes sync with having our nonce in other chains' (we are merge mined with all scrypt coins, not just Litecoin) blockchain and how that effects our syncing, if at all.
* Consider improving/tweaking payout protocols for development contributions with the goal that someone can quit their job and work full time on dogecoin development with minimal risk.
* Consider Zk-Rollups support for layer 2 as an addition to Layer 2 lightning."

Hey everyone!

I debated several formats for putting this all together and finally settled on a post here in hopes the right people pick up on it. I'm a digital accessibility advocate and was hoping to share some accessibility insights, suggestions, and tips for [the dogecoin website](https://dogecoin.com/) to increase the usability. I want to make the world a more accessible and equitable place and I hope my suggestions can give more people access to this wonderful community. Do Only Good Everyday, right?

Addressing accessibility issues on a website not only helps those with disabilities, but it increases the usability for EVERYONE and increases SEO (Search Engine Optimization)! 

I often use these examples when conducting digital accessibility trainings: 

- A wheelchair ramp leading into a building is great for those that are in a wheelchair, but can be used by anyone including a mother and stroller or a delivery person with a moving dolly. 

- We've all used those buttons next to doors that automatically open push-doors for us. Though they're intended for wheelchair bound people, they're also useful if you don't have access to your hands for any other reason (groceries, for example). Or, if you just don't want to touch the door. That's perfectly fine!

To start, I'd like to share some background on how I identify accessibility issues. Later, I'll break down the issues on the website including code snippets of how to fix the issue. You don't need to read all the jargon at the beginning. If you'd like to dive right in, feel free to jump down to the [3] Issues section.

---
##[1] Evaluation Standards
I used the [W3C's WCAG 2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/) as an evaluation standard for identifying accessibility issues. Specifically, I used the [level AA conformance level](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/conformance.html#uc-levels-head) as a baseline.

---
##[2] Evaluation Technique

In assessing the accessibility of a website, I use three methods to identify accessibility issues: Automated scanning, Manual review, and Screen reader testing

###[2.a] Automated scanning
I run several web evaluation tools to build a synthesis of accessibility issues. No one tool can pick up on everything and some tools are better than others at scanning things.

Here are some of the tools I use, in order of my recommendation. I don't always use all of them and sometimes one scan from one tool is enough to give me what I'm after.

[WAVE Evaluation Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/wave-evaluation-tool/jbbplnpkjmmeebjpijfedlgcdilocofh/related?hl=en) - Developed by WAVE.

[axe DevTools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/axe-devtools-web-accessib/lhdoppojpmngadmnindnejefpokejbdd/related?hl=en-US) - Developed by Deque.

[A11y Evaluation Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/a11y-html5-validator/cfgfmngpbhlaagbfjhellojpcpcjmnkl/related?hl=en) - Developed by A11y.

###[2.b] Manual review
Automated scanning cannot pick up on everything. Some things require human review to identify shortcomings. For example, image color contrast, reading order, font legibility.

I then disable .css on the webpage to see if the page still makes sense. If it doesn't, the markup of the page is incorrect and reader order will not be accurate for screen readers.

Next, I'll open the page in a few different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge) to make sure they all work similarly. I'll then use browser tools to see the page at different resolutions to ensure all the content is still functional. Given dogecoin.com uses Bootstrap (and subsequently flexbox), not much attention is needed here.

Finally, I use my keyboard to see if I can navigate the page and interact with all the content. [Here's a handy shortcut list for Chrome](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/157179?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en#zippy=%2Cwebpage-shortcuts).

###[2.c] Screen Reader

I use a couple of screen readers when navigating websites. [JAWS (Job Access With Speech)](https://www.freedomscientific.com/products/software/jaws/), [NVDA (NonVisual Desktop Access](https://www.nvaccess.org/), and the Apple VoiceOver software are the three that are used the 
most. I don't own a JAWS license, so I use Apple's VoiceOver software for this step. I'm really looking to see if I can make sense of the website without seeing what it looks like. Sometimes I'll set a few tasks for myself and see if I can complete them using the screen reader. For dogecoin.com, I wanted to see if I could learn about dogecoin and figure out who created the website using a screen reader. I was able to complete both tasks without issue, but there were other issues that I encountered along the way.

---
##[3] Issues
Here I'll break down the issues for each page and provide documentation on the WCAG 2.1 guideline the issue is referring to, as well as provide a recommended solution to the problem. I'll try to keep it simple.

I debated between sorting the issues chronologically on the page or grouping them by issue type. I ultimately landed on grouping them by issue type given most accessibility scanning tools do the same.

**1. [Navbar logo](https://i.imgur.com/O8d3Gbj.png)**

**Current Code**  
`<img src=""assets/img/dogecoin-300.png"">`

**How to fix**  
Add an ""alt"" tag with a text description to the image. For this instance, since there is text in the image, it's important to capture that text in the alt text

**Possible Code**  
`<img src=""assets/img/dogecoin-300.png"" alt=""Dogecoin"">`

**Current Code**  
`<img src=""assets/img/multidoge.png"" style=""max-width: 150px;"">`

**How to fix**  
Add an ""alt"" tag with a text description to the image. Avoid using terms like ""Image of..."" in the alt text. The voice over software will denote that the element is an image. Also note the space between ""Multi"" and ""doge"" in the suggestion below. Screen readers may try to join those words phonetically.

##### Very low color contrast (x6)

**Overview**: Foreground and background colors that don't have a 4.5:1 color contrast ratio for 18px font may be difficult to see.

*References*

- [WCAG 1.4 - Distinguishable](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/visual-audio-contrast.html)

**1, 2, 3 [Windows button color](https://i.imgur.com/uFwKCXY.png)**

**Current Code**  
`//From Bootstrap.css .btn-info { color: #fff; background-color: #17a2b8; border-color: #17a2b8;}`

**How to fix**  
This is actually a surprise to me. It looks like the website is using Bootstrap's default info color (#17a2b8) and Bootstrap is usually pretty good with accessibility. The color contrast for this button comes out to 3.04:1 which falls short of the required 4.5:1. It looks like the site is pulling Bootstrap from a third-party CDN so you have a few options on fixing this one. The easiest would be overwriting the .btn-info color in your styles.css with a slightly darker color.

**Possible Code**  
`//In styles.css .btn-info { color: #fff; background-color: #128091; border-color: #128091;}`

&nbsp;

**4, 5, 6 [Linux button color](https://i.imgur.com/rPCc3Gg.png)**

**Current Code**  
`//From Bootstrap.css .btn-success { color: #fff; background-color: #28a745; border-color: #28a745;}`

**How to fix**  
Similar to the info color, Bootstrap's default success color doesn't meet the 4.5:1 contrast ration with white text. Darkening the background color slightly should fix the problem.

**Possible Code**  
`//in styles.css .btn-success { color: #fff; background-color: #208337; border-color: #208337;}`

##### Missing H1

**Overview**: Headings facilitate page navigation for users of many assistive technologies. They also provide semantic and visual meaning and structure to the document. A first level heading (<h1>) should be present on nearly all pages. It should contain the most important heading on the page (generally the document title). Having a properly titled H1 also helps tremendously with SEO.

The <h1> should be before all other heading elements.

*References*

- [1.3.1 Info and Relationships](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#info-and-relationships)

- [2.4.6 Headings and Labels](https://webaim.org/standards/wcag/checklist#sc2.4.6)

**Possible Solution using in-line code**:

    <h1 class=""sr-only"">Dogecoin</h1>

The <h1> should be placed after the <nav> element. It can be placed as the first item in the <header> element. Note the use of the ""sr-only"" class. This is a Bootstrap class that hides the element visually (screen reader only).

##### Links must have discernible text (x6)

**Overview**: Links that are images or icons should have a text alternative for screen readers

I would also recommend adding a ""Skip Navigation"" link to the top of the page. It's a common practice that allows assistive technology users to skip right to the content. Those without sight limitations often visually scan the main content of the page first. Adding a ""Skip Navigation"" link will provide a similar experience to those using assistive technology.

[Read more about Skip Navigation links](https://webaim.org/techniques/skipnav/)

**How to make a Skip Navigation**
Add a ""Skip Navigation"" link as the first element within the body (just before the nav) that links to your header section. Note the ""sr-only"" class from Bootstrap that hides the element visually.

`<a class=""sr-only"" href="".masthead"">Skip Navigation</a>`

Other than finding the wallet file - is there any way to even find out information on this public address?

Before I ask about recovery, I want to know if it is even worth recovering the DOGE.

0.038,0.889,0.073,0.9243,"Let me preface this by saying, I'm not a coder, don't know cryptography, and this could all be gobbledygook.

A month or two ago I discovered Solana used a blockchain clock to help resolve their network efficiency/security.

&#x200B;

I started thinking that perhaps this could also be used in the context of a proof-of-work model. Like if say, events had a proofed time, then orphan block fairness, maybe even the need for confirmations could be resolved.

&#x200B;

A lot of proof of work mechanisms are actually striving to resolve time using propagation as a proxy (which is slower), or network timings as a padding.  You don't know when transactions occur, so you use confirmations via propagation. You don't know when blocks are mined, so that constraints block-time. Time is worked around, because there is no absolute sense of time.

Solana uses a specific variation of a Verifiable Delay Function ([https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/601.pdf](https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/601.pdf)), in their words:

""*Our specific implementation uses a sequential pre-image resistant hash that runs over itself continuously with the previous output used as the next input. Periodically the count and the current output are recorded.*""

They use SHA-256, and apparently this implementation is pretty much impossible to parallelize (ie must run single core). I'm not honestly sure of Scrypt could be used in the same way.

It's explained here:

[https://medium.com/solana-labs/proof-of-history-a-clock-for-blockchain-cf47a61a9274](https://medium.com/solana-labs/proof-of-history-a-clock-for-blockchain-cf47a61a9274)

Because it's single core, and the speeds at which ASICs running SHA-256 are predictable, they can also approximate the bounds in which this can be speed up (30% or so). Making it, so within these boundaries, they can have certainty of it's honesty. As far as I understand it, because it's published, uses unique input data, and it's sequential, it cannot be modified retrospectively nor can the hashes be reused. Linked to specific events (ie with those events as input data), like transactions and blocks, it should make those events also non-malleable.

I heard that originally Satoshi actually wanted to implement a blockchain clock prior to settling on his solution for bitcoin. In a sense, proof of work acts as a clock. I wonder is this still possible to integrate a clock with tighter timing into a Proof-of-Work system?

I have no idea if this is doable, but it does seem to me one of the central design flaws of proof of work is not knowing time. If it was possible to create a reliably proofed time, some slower mechanisms could be replaced or eliminated. Orphan blocks, in theory at least would then come down not to centralization but how much lost work is tolerable to miners and the network - which in itself would come down to efficiency and network speed.

If confirmations aren't able to be eliminated, they could at least be reduced. Of course efficiency in blockchain propagation itself would be key - if there's too much variability, it would limit the use of this.

Please accept again, that I am not a coder, and I could have all this wildly wrong. I do grasp though that this would essentially be completely altering how the chain propagates and how immutable history functions, and is by no means a simple thing."
0.527,0.453,0.021,-0.9994,"One of the things that's not at all apparent when we do a major update, is how much checking there is that nothing's broken. Bitcoin Core (which we modify into Dogecoin Core) comes with a LOT of automated tests, which is great, but a lot of them work specifically around how Bitcoin does, so when we make small changes, there's like ten to one fixes to tests to verify everything.

Cause there's no regulation. We talk alot about fiat and how that's infinite aswell, but unlike Doge. There are burning facilities to regulate the amount of fiat so it wont get too low.

An idea for Doge is to adopt the same method. To have burning facilities. Simply to balance the infinite supply.

Id suggest a ""tax"" on transactions. And that tax went directly into a burning wallet. If doge got mass adoption this could potentielly result in a raise of price. And the procentage that gets burned could be increased/decreased based on the amount of people that adopts it. The more people who adopts it the less the tax.

I know people don't want taxes on their gains, but ask yourself this. Would you rather have no tax and Doge at a lower price or would you have tax and Doge at a higher price? Im not talking $5 - $100 price. Im talking $1 as stablecoin. If Doge should become the people's coin. It cant surpass the $1 benchmark. I know people want Doge to skyrocket to double digit dollar, but that's nlt healthy for Doge. It wont become the people's coin. Not everyone can afford to buy something that coats $10+.

I wanted to ask with all candor if there has ever been a discussion in making Dogecoin more ""green"" than Bitcoin (I know that at this point Bitcoin's effect on the environment is much heavier than the one of cryptos like Litecoin or Doge), either by modifying the way the currency is mined (I know this would be probably close to impossible at this stage) or by creating an incentive to mine with green energy.

What is your take on this problem, which is important for all of us at this point? I saw several topics about this being downvoted in the past weeks at [r/dogecoin](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/), hence I decided to ask you.

Thanks"

I came here to bring an idea:

Doge/Doge needs some other Tokens/Doge working alltogether on the Dogechain, like a Stable/Doge fixed in USD, a Integer/Doge, a Deflationary-burn/Doge, and a Yield/Doge, all these tokens giving liquidity options to Doge/Doge on the same chain. This could allow that another types of investments occurr inside the Doge ecossystem."

This guide assumes Win 10. Also for advanced users reference [https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/l8b7d4/dogecoin\_blockchain/](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/l8b7d4/dogecoin_blockchain/)

0. Exit the wallet by clicking ""file"" and ""exit"". You should see a ""shutting down"" dialog. If you aren't sure if dogecoin is running check in the taksbar at the bottom of your screen or the little icon in the lower right of your screen. Just clicking the red checkmark in the top right of the screen doesn't necessarily exit the program! We are doing this because we are accesing the important dogecoin folder, and messing with the wallet.dat file in any way like just renaming it while the wallet is on, can corrupt the file and loose your coins! I know this from experience!

1. Now that you have exited dogecoin program, go to:

C: -> Users -> (your user name)

2. Look at the top of the screen. Find the ""view"" tab. Find the ""hidden items"" box. Check the box. Also check the box for ""file name extensions"".

3. App data -> Roaming -> Dogecoin

4. IMPORTANT! Your wallet.dat file is critical, if you delete it or it gets corrupted, you will loose your coins! You CAN copy this file though as a backup, just be very careful. Make sure your wallet is exited out and shut down fully. Click the wallet.dat file. Right click it. Click copy. Right click in the white area of the folder. Click paste. Now you have a backup just in case. If you ever need to run this backup file, you can rename the current wallet.dat file to wallet1.dat or whatever you want to call it, and rename the wallet-copy.dat file to just wallet.dat however DO NOT RENAME A WALLET FILE WHILE DOGECOIN IS RUNNING EVER, YOUR COINS WILL BE LOST!  Make about 5 more copies of the wallet-copy.dat file.  If you corrupt one file, the next file you use might be corrupted too so you need many copies on hand to be safe.  These wallet file copies will still work correctly even after you receive new coins into your account.  This is because the wallet.dat file contains hundreds of addresses so it will always be valid.

5. Right click the white area of the folder. Click ""new"" then ""text document"". Rename it dogecoin.conf

6. Open dogecoin.conf and paste in the following lines. Then save it.

There are two releases currently being worked on:

* Next minor, 1.14.4: https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin/tree/1.14.4-dev
* Next major, 1.21: https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin/tree/1.21-dev

1.14.4 is the target for all quick wins and bug fixes we can push out quickly and will be used as a staging release for fee changes.

1.21 is a major refresh of the code base using Bitcoin Core 0.21, to build future work on top of.  It is at very early stages, and is only intended for developers who can help us progress the client. The current focus is fixing automated tests which have broken while introducing Dogecoin changes, as a precursor to addressing an issue where block download fails after a node exits the initial block download phase.

Both of these releases have their own project boards in GitHub:

* 1.14.4: https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin/projects/3

0.147,0.725,0.128,-0.9867,"Hello all, there's a lot of reasonable discussion regarding transaction fees lately. Most of those claims are that transaction fees are too high, and make small transactions unreasonable. Folks are weighing in and saying that transaction fees should be in the 1/2 a cent range, or around 0.01 DOGE by current price (\~$0.5). Elon Musk, a business man and active Twitter user, has personally asked for a 100X reduction in DOGE fees (around 1/20 of a cent). I wanted to formulate a post to align the discussion around the metrics, and clarify why transaction fees exist.

**On the subject of transaction fees**: by associating a cost with a transaction (TX), you solve an important problem: you limit spam TXs which can be harmful to a cryptocurrency. With the current TX fee, DOGE is extremely spam-resistant. But, before we move on, there are two other considerations: (1) by including a fee, miners receive an additional payment outside of the typical block rewards (subsidy) and (2) you provide a means for TX speed competition, where miners are able to set personal limits on fees. Assuming wallets are implemented well, the miners will be able to compete (lowering fees to solve more transactions, like a company acquiring clientele) and you will get the best TX fee at any given time. In relation to spam, this will allow miners to lower their prices to attractive amounts - but won't remove the fee entirely, ensuring a spam attack isn't feasible. With the current relay strategy, this is not being encouraged as much as it could be. **Luckily, this is something the devs are aware of**. So the next part is basically going to be a scale of the considerations, and hopefully you can identify if there is anything I've missed.

Considerations \~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

**Miners**: miners aren't a priority in determining fees. While they do receive an additional payment from fees, it's a side-effect rather than a priority. A coin \*can\* exist without fees, or extremely low fees, and it will still have miners so long as they see a potential in the coin's appreciation, or if the coin has enough use-cases to be valuable and worth the mining process.

*IMO: Miners should not be considered when calculating fees. They should be happy with what they get! Which is roughly 70 DOGE per block currently.*

**Spam**: limiting spam is the #1 priority. So this becomes a vulnerability consideration; how much spam will harm the coin, who would want to do this harm, who has the ability to do this harm, and how can we prevent it.

*IMO: Threats could range all the way from a government (\~200 million USD) down to commercial bad actors (\~10 million USD) per attack. Commercial bad actors are the most likely threat vector. A coin is harmed by spam when the block space begins to fill each minute, and as a result the fee increases or disrupts node syncing. The DOGE max block size is 500Kb so the theoretical transactions per second would be 33 TX/s. At 1,980 TX/min, 1981 TX would begin to cause problems. The average TX/min is 22 TXs, so that would require roughly 1959 TX/min of spam, climbing towards 1980 TX/min. To truly affect the chain, this would need to occur, sustained, over multiple days/weeks/months.*

**Cost**: This sort of builds into the above. It can be built by two considerations: (1) how much spam would be required to harm the chain by increasing costs; once you know that you can estimate a cost-value with that. (2) How valuable is preventing spam? This one is less important, but will come into play when selecting a realistic threat.

The second big consideration for cost is, cost of using the coin. To be a realistic currency, using the coin shouldn't be a high cost relative to what you can buy. Because of this, the desire to keep fees low is strong.

*IMO: we should start with the second part of the first consideration and the second part of the whole consideration to form a baseline limit. Taxes are roughly 2.5-8% for everyday items. DOGE TXs should probably be less than that because then you are paying double taxes for each TX. But realistically, $0.01USD is unnoticeable, so we know the limit should be between $0.01 and 8% of a cup of coffee, or $0.16.*

*Next we can determine the cost of sustaining an attack for a series of time intervals at a series of costs. To describe the attack, it would take roughly $42,768,000 to fill 1980 TX/min @ 1DOGE (\~$0.5) ea. for one month. Considering a commercial bad actor with a sustained attack for a week, the cost associated with this scenario should be more than $10 million. If we consider that a cup of coffee is purchased for every TX (@$2/cup) that would amount to an 8% tax associated value of $3,193,344. If the $0.16 fee is used, it would bring the cost of a weekly attack to $13,885,344 which is above the limit of a commercial bad actor, but not unreasonable. At $0.01 TX fee, the total cost would be $10,891,584, which is fairly close to the potential threat. Given more detail and technical figures, we could probably draft a realistic scenario which facilitates a strong TX fee.*

Spam Solutions\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

Transaction fees are just one solution to the spam problem. Other solutions have been tried by other coins, such as the back-log process for Nano which they implemented recently in response to a spam attack. There is also the Throughput model, where a sending address must provide proof-of-work (PoW) on two other transaction, thereby turning the spammers into workers. There is the reputation model, which would require a central authority to grant reputation to approved senders (not at all recommended for DOGE).

Overall, there is some initial justification to decrease the TX fees, absent of other improvements to the process. Thoughts?

EDIT: Just wanted to clarify, **this is something the devs are aware of**. I am making this post to share my analysis and ask for thoughts, improvements, suggestions from the community."

0.027,0.86,0.113,0.9935,"Hello guys,

I asked this question a while ago, and I was notified by one of the developers that I would have received a reply by the development team about this in a public thread. I am asking this again as I see a lot of misconceptions, also in well written articles, where it is constantly stated that Dogecoin development is entirely based on ""for free"" efforts and no funding is available to developers in case of need. This is often used as an example of the ""weakness"" of Dogecoin, also against other sister projects like Litecoin.

We know there is an official tip jar for Dogecoin development which holds around 24 million doge (1.4M USD at the current market price)**.** The developers can access it via a multisig wallet, so they must all accept/confirm a withdrawal. This is a big amount of money, and whenever I share this bit of information people are shocked and see the whole enterprise as more legitimate.

There is also a lot of confusion around the tipjar, as also this thread from a month ago shows ([https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoindev/comments/lkx2od/dogecoin\_devs\_what\_are\_your\_actual\_thoughts\_on/gnmrj81?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoindev/comments/lkx2od/dogecoin_devs_what_are_your_actual_thoughts_on/gnmrj81?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)); issues include wrong addresses in old threads (**in particular with an address still holding 14M Dogecoin in it, but of which even** u/rnicol **knows nothing about**) and stuff like that (u/rnicoll redacted some of those old threads now).

My questions are:

1. Can we advertise a bit more the existence of this quite sizeable tipjar, also for the press writing about Dogecoin?
2. What is the current strategy in the way this fund is being used? I know part of it is used to spin Dogecoin nodes when new versions are released, but is there some way to democratize access to this fund, so that for example the community can vote on how this fund is being used?

As an example, we have the recent [Dogecoin.com](https://Dogecoin.com) redesign, which is nicely done but could be pushed further with some additional funds, as they did with the [Bitcoin.org](https://Bitcoin.org) tipjar for the website, which allows them to iterate and work on the website much more frequently, also including interactive/blogging features when needed. Or it could be used to hire a professional UI/UX designer to streamline and simplify the wallet experience (I know, some veterans are against making the wallet too easy to use, but in general I do not agree).

I am all for the fun side of Doge, but I believe it is fundamental to deal with this aspect transparently - crystal-clear transparency - also for the possibility it might attract talents which just do not have the time to work for free but that might benefit the community as a whole.

And by ""attract talents"", I do not mean established, famous coders and designers, but also developers from disadvantaged backgrounds which might have great skills but cannot afford to lose even one day of work on an unpaid task due to their living expenses and financial situation.

Just let us know!

Edit: added further information about wrong tipjar funds links and about the possibility of attracting talents."

0.018,0.834,0.148,0.9942,"I've seen quite a few people on various subs and social media suggesting the idea of including bounties for completing helpful projects that advance work on the coin. I've engaged in a few productive conversations about this and here is my suggestion for how it could possibly work.

Before this is brought up- I have seen that there is a developer fund that compensates contributing developers upon a major release. However I wonder if an individualistic approach to these rewards could be more motivating, as it is often a fairly large amount of time between major releases.  Visible, scaling rewards could assure them that they will receive something timely that is appropriate to their contribution.

I understand that the major problem whenever funding projects is brought up is that the Developers rightfully do not want to be beholden to any one entity. Retaining decentralization is vital, it is what this is all about after all. So there are two ways I could see this working.

The core Developers supply projects for the community to engage in at varying levels. Upon completion and pending review, a reward is given which is scaled to the complexity of the project, time spent, etc. These variables could be decided on by the devs before the bounty is issued, and the guidelines for successful completion could be posted for anyone wanting to attempt to complete the bounty, so that there is no confusion. This could help motivate more progress (and more effective, focused help) without compromising any of our ideals.

Or

The community decides what projects they want to work on. After completion of a project, the core Developers vote together to decide whether a given project is helpful or not. Then, rewards are decided on and scaled to usefulness (a tier system could be implemented to measure this), project complexity, etc.

Initially I had considered this working from a broader consensus..but I understand that the devs would probably want the voting parties to be subject matter experts. That said, I do believe that some sort of additional organizational infrastructure can be built here without risking centralization or involving any hierarchy that does not already exist.

Finally, if this is a redundant post I apologize, I've tried to comb through and see if this has been brought up before (and in how much detail) but there is a lot to read through atm.

Ross talked about how it wasn't a good idea to do upgrades more than every 18 months because it takes nodes that long on average to upgrade.

One possible reason for this is because they feel they are only 1 upgrade behind so it is not a big deal.  But if they got a couple upgrades behind they might feel more urge to upgrade.  The slow pace of development feeds into the thought of everyone that there just isn't that active of development on dogecoin, and no pressing need to update.

Also people could read the update notes and just decide that they weren't experiencing any issues that the upgrade fixed, so why upgrade?

Another possible reason is there have been many reports of encrypted wallets not opening in future versions, this scares people to upgrade and risk that perhaps their passcode doesn't work anymore.  So people are afraid to upgrade.

In conclusion I think if there were more recent and more impactful updates, the adoption rate would improve from 18 months it currently sits at.  The developers set the pace of the network, they shouldn't follow the least common denominator.

MishaBoar in the comments brings up several good points including one point that perhaps the 18 month adoption curve is actually decreasing, with the popularity 1.14.3 has probably been widely adopted well before the 18 month mark.  It would be good to get confirmation on this."

They came together in what felt like a few days to reach the funding amount and the rest is now history. That kind of community alignment was easier to do when the community was small and I think for the size we are at today this approach no longer works.

Years is also a rather long time, where people change. Not in malicious ways but in manners where expectations, desires, and motivations change. Due to this I personally feel that there is no longer a place where I fit in the cohesive and functional group in a manner that aligns with their shifting ideals. This is not inherently bad, with change comes growth and new things even. Developmental groups in crypto are loosely based on agreed ideals, desires or directions.

I just read a post on reddit from two months ago that got my attention. Two months ago would be Feb 2021. This is important as what I am about to show you has been going on for 5 years and has not gotten the attention it deserves. Until now.

In this post the user **xXx\_69Killer420\_xXx** asks how to retrieve the dogecoin sent from his wallet to another wallet foreign to him. This is the excerpt that was familiar to me:

*'But after I put in my address it changed in the app and the dogecoin got sent somewhere else. I checked the address they got sent to and it still has them and doesn't have any other dogecoin and hasn't made any transactions. '*

So the only way you could do it is if you copy an existing address that is not yours and paste it and send. And you would think it would have to be an address that he has used before

QUESTION [#1](https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin/pull/1): HOW DO WE SEE WHEN THAT ADDRESS WAS CREATED AND IS THERE AN IP ADDRESS THAT IS TIED TO IT? SOMETHING? Because the only thing that make sense is the address was created at send. The question is does the user have control over that address to access the coins.

You can see he has that one transaction in that address and it has not moved since 2018

Now we come to me. On June 27th 2016 I had the same thing happen. my doge was sent to an address that I did not put in the send to field.

**\*\*REMOVED SCREEN SHOT - THIS SHOWS THE SEND FROM MY WALLET TO  DMLtAYk2mPFsH1MEET7BQtQFRSmV4XnA9v**

This address **DMLtAYk2mPFsH1MEET7BQtQFRSmV4XnA9v** is not on my wallet list of receiving addresses. And just like the other two gentlemen, my doge has been sitting in that address untouched for nearly 5 years .

**\*\*REMOVED SCREEN SHOT - JUST GOTO dogecoin explorer for DMLtAYk2mPFsH1MEET7BQtQFRSmV4XnA9v**

Can you reliably reproduce the issue? No I can't but there are two good untouched examples. 1. from 2018 and one from 2016If so, please list the steps to reproduce below:Expected behaviour

Tell us what should happenExpected behaviour is the dogecoin should not have sent at all. Or should not have sent to these phantom addresses/

Actual behaviour

Tell us what happens instead

What version of Dogecoin Core are you using?

List the version number/commit ID, and if it is an official binary, self compiled or a distribution package such as PPA.1.14

Any extra information that might be useful in the debugging process.

I think its important to see how and when the two phantom addresses in question were created

DF61X3Gn1H8zVeV2QoERgprKAivufsVkA4 - from the github user doge0901 in 2018

DMLtAYk2mPFsH1MEET7BQtQFRSmV4XnA9v - from me in 2016

The 3rd address in 2021 was not posted by reddit user xXx\_69Killer420\_xXx, but sounds like the same issue. And before anyone discounts this as just an incorrect send, if my memory serves me correctly I didn't initiate the send it just happened and its seems like the other two gentlemen are saying the same thing. But lets not get caught up in that. The bottom line is even if we initiated the transaction, where would we have gotten the address from? I would have had to copy it from somewhere right? I would not luck into sending dogecoin to an accidental address. No one types these things and at the time I had done 4 transactions ever on dogecoin network, the two initial trades, the two sends to my wallet and then this 5 one the anomaly occurred.

I would think we are not the only 3 this has happened to. When it happens you think I guess I just lost my dogecoin but that should only be the case where there is user error. Here is a NETWORK ISSUE. This happened do to the network not the user i can guarantee it. I am sure anyone else it happened do miscommunicated it and was bashed and let it go or just bashed and let it go. But with a $46B marketcap this cannot happen. So let me know what can be done. Losing the dogecoin because of a user error i can accept but not for a network issue. Agree? Thanks!!!"

I am thinking about:

**For every 1 Doge that will be sent is added a 0.001 Doge transaction fee**

so..

examples:

sending 1 Doge x 0.001 = 0.001 Doge fee / 0.999 received

sending 10 Doge x 0.001 = 0.01 Doge fee / 9.99 received

sending 100 Doge x 0.001 = 0.1 Doge fee / 99,9 received

sending 1.000 Doge x 0.001 = 1 Doge fee / 999 received

sending 10.000 Doge x 0.001 = 10 Doge fee / 9.990 received

sending 100.000 Doge x 0.001 = 100 Doge fee / 99.900 received

sending 1.000.000 Doge x 0.001 = 1000 Doge fee / 999.000 received

and so on...

&#x200B;

this is the only way keeping the usage as a currency alive.

with a system like that it also makes sense tipping small amounts of Dogecoin like in reallife giving just a few cents / dollars.

people with daily / small amount pay very low fees

rich people pay much higher fees for moving / selling lots of coins.

we already have the problem that few adresses have too many coins and over the years i think fees with a system like that will make it very fair.

0.016,0.853,0.131,0.985,"Hello, my name is Choof and i'm making a Dogecoin inspired game. Here's what it looks like a couple weeks into development.

[Week 2 Progress](https://reddit.com/link/mxu8xx/video/7vmnmha737v61/player)

**What is Flappy Doge?**

I was never a fan of Flappy Bird clones, so I decided to make my own (kinda ironic). The difference is you play as a doge, collect dogecoins, and hodl doge.

**Whats new?**

Been making some good progress, and it's finally starting to feel like a playable game. I spent most of the week building a foundation for the project (API stuff, manager scripts, playerprefs etc..) . Making the assets took FOREVER. I've never done pixel art before so it's a major learning curve for me.

* Created a completely new set of assets.
   * If you saw my last dev log you know why.
* Changed the old scoring system to collecting doge.
* Added CoinGecko API to get the DOGE:USDT conversion rate in realtime.
   * Used it to display your doge value in USD.

**Whats next?**

I need to add some playability to the game. As of now, it's REALLY boring. I figured if you spend all your time collecting DOGE, you need some way to use it. In the following week, I will start looking into a portfolio management system. Here are some of the things I plan to do:

* Add a way to accumulate DOGE.
* Adjust your earnings based on the size of you're portfolio.
* Add incremental difficulty.
* Add an earning multiplier the further you go in one run.
* Idea: Add a rare shiny dogecoin that pays more DOGE.

I have a lot of ideas for the near future. I was thinking about adding a way to save your doge and earn interest somehow. I will keep you updated!

**Have a fantastic day**

If you guys enjoyed this let me know and I will continue writing updates. The game is still in early development, but I will be creating a Google Play page soon so you can follow it. Hope you guys like the progress!"

I'm the lead dev for DogeBSC. Sorry about the lack of technical detail in the whitepaper, we're intentionally keeping it on the down low until closer to launch.

We're using public apis for interacting with the Dogecoin network and DogeBSC on BEP20, so nowhere near as high tech as what you guys get up to. Controlling transactions / swaps between wallets. And due to our size, if needed a liquidity balancer through an exchange.  We're just trying to get something out asap at this stage and then will upgrade / inhouse components when we can scale up our dev team. Totally happy to share more details if you're free for a chat, would be great to get your opinion & insights into some of the things were planning.  Our tokenomics allows for a community fund / budget, so if you guys ever need funds/resources for anything - it's probably tiny compared to what you guys have available to work with but we'd love the opportunity to support the growth of Doge wherever possible. Our community is also at hand if needs be. Were definitely no competition to Doge, but if we could fill the shoes of a slightly annoying younger (adopted) brother, that'd be awesome

0.028,0.889,0.083,0.9697,"Hi all,

I've asked this question before and have had no luck getting in to my wallet.  However, there are some revelations / updates and I was hoping that someone could give me an opinion or help.  My wallet currently has 1,000,005 dogecoin in it, but comes up as locked.  I don't ever remember setting a password on this wallet and it's mind-boggling to me as to what happened with all of this.  But, here's some weird stuff.

Recently I got back to working on my wallet as I had gotten discouraged and walked away last year.  I installed 1.10 as my client to be the closest wallet possible to the last date that I would have been using doge and hopefully have some success in recovery.

Previously, I would load a wallet that showed 1,003,000 coins and it would be encrypted & locked.  There were also other wallets that showed 2,995 coins and then a variety that were between 70,000 and 147,000 that were also unlocked.  I thought that was pretty good because at least I had 200k give or take that I could play with.

This morning I started a -reindex on the wallet.dat that I had previously unlocked with 2,995 coins.  Everything worked fine and I sent them to a different wallet for storage.  I then grabbed a wallet that made sense that it might have the 1,003,000 in it and threw it in the folder, renamed to wallet.dat and loaded it up.  The doge client rescanned the file and it now says 1,000,005 and still locked.  It also shows my transactions from today from the other (unlocked) wallet file.

How is this happening?  One file that is unlocked and I can access... everything is fine, and then another file that has the remainder of my coins, shows it as locked and encrypted but also shows the transaction that I sent from the first wallet I loaded today.

This is my locked wallet:  [DH5yaieqoZN36fDVciNyRueRGvGLR3mr7L - Dogecoin Address (bitinfocharts.com)](https://bitinfocharts.com/dogecoin/address/DH5yaieqoZN36fDVciNyRueRGvGLR3mr7L)

This is the hash info from the 2993 (I sent 2 earlier as a test) coins from the unlocked wallet:28424ced90cb9c2811bcf0eee18dfce1e693bc3bddb2a9c646e2c01831bf8912

As you can see; I've had these coins for a LONG time and I've been dealing with the locked wallet since 2018.  I'm obviously watching the hype now and so confused as to what happened.  Again, I don't remember setting a password and my wife doesn't remember that either.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.Thanks"

""Thanks for your interest! I've always loved doge and it continues to be my second favorite crypto to this day :)

A two-way-peg definitely seems like a decent approach that opens the door to using DOGE with ethereum contracts but at the same time doesn't inflict platform risk on your community. Basically, the approach would be on the ethereum side to modify btcrelay into dogerelay (the hardest part there being implementing scrypt in EVM code; realistically you'd probably have to spread out the verifier over multiple transactions, and use a security deposit scheme so that you don't actually have to run verifications most of the time), and then create an ethereum contract where you can burn 1 DOGE to create 1 E-DOGE.

To convert back you let people burn E-DOGE in a way that generates a receipt, and then have a voting mechanic in the blockchain where ethereum-aware miners can vote +1 or -1 on the blockchain regarding whether or not each receipt is valid. Once a receipt reaches +100, the recipient gets 1 DOGE (this mechanic is essentially borrowed from Paul Sztorc's drivechain proposal). This mechanic could be implemented in a way that is a soft-fork on the dogecoin side, and only a contract on the ethereum side."""

I have a deployed 1.21 node, which is good, although there's definitely work be be done on 1.21 still:

* The deployed node syncs headers but it does not appear to request blocks from its peers. Even more confusingly, running 1.21 on my local machine _does_ sync blocks.
* Bitcoin Core 0.21 (which Dogecoin Core 1.21 is based on) is designed for DNS seeds which support version bits, ours do not, which means it reports that it finds zero nodes from the seeds. Work on enabling our DNS seeds to support this is already underway.
* Dogecoin Core 1.21 does not appear to discover nodes at all, right now, although if nodes are manually added, or connect _to_ the node, it works.
* The functional test suite needs validating after AuxPoW has been added, which may resolve some of these bugs as a side-effect.

Once those are out of the way, there's a bunch of more minor things to tweak so we can start mainnet testing, and then rebranding.

Fee work in 1.14.4 continues, I believe that's in testing, hoping Michi & Max will have further updates on that.

Obviously with Elon talking about environmental impact that's something that's being discussed. As we share work with Litecoin we already reduce that impact, compared to mining either cryptocurrency alone, but definitely it would be good if we can further reduce that impact. Counterpoint, I am aware that many in the community enjoy mining and feel it‚Äôs a key part of the experience for them, as well as considerations of whether an approach such as proof of stake would make Dogecoin appear to be a security and fall under securities regulation aside from many technical challenges that approach brings.

What I mean is, we‚Äôre aware of it, we don‚Äôt have any easy answers.

Meanwhile I‚Äôm going to continue work on the automated test suites, which hopefully will as a result simplify diagnosing the networking issues with 1.21, and it in turn should provide a better synchronization process."

You‚Äôd have to work out the conversation of doge to carbon credits and maybe make carbon credits more expensive overtime using an algorithm I order to reduce carbon usage over time and get around the new issuance of dogecoin supply. 

Maybe using green technology like electric cars and solar panels can mine doge to reward people for reducing their carbon footprint.

IF the transaction fees become higher than the blockchain potential there could be a decrease in ETH supply at a decreasingly amount over time.

This will be a pathway for ETH to burn as well as, and hopefully likely, Dogecoin."

I've been watching a few other blockchain projects, and here's what I noticed:  Professional software development teams with plans to achieve massive scalability really take a coin far.

Look at ETH for example:  They're working on sharing in 2.0 to achieve massive scalability and reduce transaction fees.  AVAX is another example: they have some of the best devs, already achieved extreme scalability and functionality, and their price rocketed.


I haven't been in doge for very long, and I'm not saying that it needs smart contract capabilities,  but I've noticed its software development infrastructure is severely lacking.  

I was wanting to build a web app for Doge, and came here to ask about a JavaScript library that I could use for my project.  

https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoindev/comments/lngvu6/dogecoin_js_library/

To my disappointment, the only ones that were available were very limited and didn't have the functionality I needed.  I'm sorry, but if your project has been around for a while and you don't even have a decent JavaScript library, it's not going very far.


Look, I want Doge to do really well.  I already believe its meme and marketing is better than all of the other coins.  

Here's what needs to happen:

1.  Find professional block chain developers.  Go around to other top prjects, find professionals, inquiry what value they could provide in terms of scalability, library development, etc. and how much they would do it for.

2.  Create a roadmap and business plan of all the major improvements that would come, and how many millions need to be raised to deliver.

That's it.  I'm pretty sure such a large amount could be raised to step up the Doge game, especially if Elon Musk is onboard.

0.143,0.739,0.118,-0.8144,"I've been quiet because still trying various solutions to how to test Dogecoin's coinbase maturity values. Work in progress is in https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin/pull/1780

Bit of a history lesson here, but first what is coinbase maturity? When a miner mines a block, they get a reward. To encourage chain health, they don't get that reward immediately, instead there's a maturation period before the reward is available to spend. This encourages them to build more blocks (get reward faster), for example.

Dogecoin when first launched it had a maturation period of 30 blocks, or about half an hour. This turned out to be too low, which led to a bunch of risks we hadn't expected, so it was raised to 240 blocks (4 hours). Bitcoin uses 100 blocks, so we now have three different values (30, 100, 240) floating around.

The functional tests in Bitcoin are built around that 100 block value, which means a lot of assumptions they make on behaviour break when Dogecoin values are introduced. Adding more complexity, the Bitcoin test framework pre-generates 200 blocks spread over 4 nodes (so 50 each), however different tests use different numbers of nodes, so some tests start at 200 blocks, some at 100, some at 50. Simply increasing that pre-generated bundle by 140 (to maintain 100 matured nodes, after the 240 block maturation period) breaks a bunch of tests where they expect block height to be one value, and it's now another.

Increasing the block height naively in tests doesn't work, because features such as SegWit are enabled at defined heights, so again tests find features enabled ""too early"" and break. Changing coinbase maturation on RegTest to 100 blocks would be simpler, but we'd miss any impact from coinbase maturation period on, say, mempool behaviour.

Bonus round; the way the coinbase switch-over is implemented is inconsistent, so some tests see the 30 block maturation period AND the 240 block maturation period, and never work.

Currently looking at:

* Using a single maturation period of 240 blocks in all RegTest tests.
* Adding 140 blocks to the cached set of blocks produced by the test framework.
* Updating expected heights in tests to match.
* Cleaning up remaining breaking cases.

You can see the various experiments in the PR https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin/pull/1780

* Increasing feature activation heights by 140 blocks to compensate."

[Switch to Proof of Interaction, an algorithm that requires small amount of computational power while being secure. \[feat\] ¬∑ Issue #2059 ¬∑ dogecoin/dogecoin (github.com)](https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin/issues/2059)

**Full paper here:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.07763](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.07763)

*Proof of Interaction* requires a small amounts of computational power that is resistant to selfish mining. In addition, it solves the issues of Proof of Work's computational power and Proof of Stake's security issues.

**How it works**

""when a user wants to access a resource in a server that is heavily requested, the server can ask the user to perform a tour of a given length in the network. This tour consists of accessing randomly a list of nodes, own by the same provider as the server. After the tour, a user can prove to the server that it has completed the task and can then retrieve the resource.""

**Here are some keypoints:**

* Uses less computational power than Proof of Work
* More secure than Proof of Stake
* Resistant to selfish mining, meaning everyone is equal, doesn't matter whether if Bob has a more powerful computer than Alice.

So far, no proof of concept was currently made for the algorithm. This thread is a continuing discussion.

0.041,0.896,0.062,0.594,"I was thinking about the whale pump and dumper problem and thought of something. We already see this in payment-related services and that's putting transaction limits based on x number of transactions done in y time, or z value of transactions done in y time, or a combination of both. So why not have a cooldown timer where when you send a certain amount, programmatically, the cooldown will take into effect depending on the amount you send.

For example, every time a single Dogecoin wallet sends:

- 1-9,999 sent: +5 minute cooldown
- 10,000 - 24,999: +10 minute cooldown
- 25,000 - 49,999: +30 minute cooldown
- 50,000 - 99,999: +2 hour cooldown
- *For every 100,000: +3 hour cooldown
- *For every 1,000,000: +48 hour cooldown

For every 100k you send, There is a cooldown time of +2 hours. For every 1m sent, it's +48 hour cool down. So if you send 1.5m, that's 48h + 15h = 63h cooldown

In this way, the would-be pump and dumper cannot keep on sending a ton in a short period of time. This can be adjusted later on as the Dogeconomy evolves.

In the Tron network, there's other parameters like Energy and Bandwidth which limit what you can do with your TRX. You have to freeze TRX to gain Energy/Bandwidth. Since Dogecoin doesn't have this, maybe programming a cooldown timer might be feasible without too much work to add.

If that's not enough, because a whale bot can probably control multiple wallet addresses, then add a fee that scales when sending 500000+ Doges? The network needs to make it very expensive for pump and dumpers to execute their ladder attacks.

Just another set of ideas to add to the pile, what do you guys think?"

After storing, I got really busy and could not pay much attention to the wallet. For safety, I protected the wallet with a password. I then made a backup of the wallet, to keep in a separate drive. 

&#x200B;

Some time after, I changed the hard drive (HD) on my computer (kept the old one just in case I needed it). However, when I tried to access the old HD this year, I was unable to access it. My guess, the drive got corrupted, and since the OS was encrypted, I don't think that the regular recovery software would work (please correct me if any of you know any software tools for recovering an SSD, with Ubuntu hard drive/OS encryption, that got corrupted). 

So I tried using the backup I created before changing the HD on my computer, but now I face another issue. Apparently, when I made the backups, since I was still starting with crypto, I did not manually export the keys. HOWEVER, it seems that MultiDoge did an automatic backup of the keys to the ""multidoge-data/key-backup/"" directory, which got copied with my wallet backup. However, this key must be either encrypted or encoded in some way, because the format is not the correct format for a doge wallet key. I tried to import this key when I tried to restore the MultiDoge wallet on my new SSD, but the client is not recognizing my password.

In 2014, I  acquired dogecoin for around 2 months through various transactions on  ebay and other means. Up until last week, that laptop sat on a shelf  with a dead battery and no internet connection whatsoever.

At  the beginning of this month, I downloaded a new 64 bit wallet, overwrote the wallet.dat file and allowed the wallet to update and  download the blockchain.

As it  finished this morning, I realized that on 5/6/2021, a -50,000  transaction had occurred WITHOUT any knowledge whatsoever on my part. My  old and new wallets show as being fully locked and no passphrases were  EVER given out, printed or ever looked at.

Looking  into more detail into this ""transaction"", it is CLEAR someone STOLE my  coins by tracking down an older transaction and redirecting it into  THEIR wallet. This is the address of the thief:    DGoBxd82tyyhPBbd1qcmAdqJVsWyANnNsQ

Dogecoin has massive fervor behind it; however, user adoption is a problem. That‚Äôs why today i‚Äôm proud to announce the alpha release and ongoing development of a Helm Chart and Docker images for running a Dogecoin FullNode on Kubernetes. It's rough and early, but I felt it more important to get this out to the world for collaboration opportunities instead of trying to deliver something overly polished 2 months from now. This will help standardization and make it easier to run Dogecoin in a server environment, develop for it, mine coins, and help secure the network. Most importantly, it‚Äôs a step in the right direction for reducing the barrier of entry into crypto. Using this vehicle, we can:

* Make it easier for anyone to run and operate Dogecoin FullNodes
* Enhance developer experience and tap into the massive Kubernetes ecosystem
* Lower the barrier of entry into crypto for education and for make benefit glorious community projects of Doge!
* Use it as a starting point for a Community Dogecoin DevOps program

Higher rewards for transactions are more appealing  for the miner, i understand.

As it is the coin of  people, priorities should be done counting transactions of a wallet per day. if it is the first transaction (such send or much receive) of a wallet its prio 1, second is prio 2 etc.  like a normal consumer has like 30 Transactions per day . So we could reset the priorisation iterator  with the rise of the moon (nightfall). or maybe you can set it to whatever (24+) time you want... to seperate your transactions ""in the middle"".

the assigned priority could be increased per time.

With this we would solve a part of the fan in / fan out problem don't we?

This will give it the foundation it needs to be recognized by coinbase and other platforms as well as the ability to make sure the developers get paid for the work they put it. This could also lead to the possibility of full-time employment opportunities for developers as well as a platform to give devs the recognition they deserve, which could lead to unlimited possibilities. 

This coin truly does have the potential to become the peoples currency as well as help alot of people that desperately need it, the entire reason for the coin. 

I expect nothing in return, no payment nothing and im not even asking for a return on the start up costs, I will put the money, time and work up to implement it acquiring 501c3 status. 

It will be structured so that a vote is needed for any payments, decisions etc and the board will be filled with non paid members and all funds will go to the development of the coin. 

I can't do this without support so please contact me if this is something you will support, im ready to get started asap and will provide a complete public structure implementation plan upon confirmation of support.

0.024,0.843,0.134,0.9976,"# 1. Introduction

I keep seeing people coming back to the community and trying to restore or recover their wallets. Most of them already have the wallet.dat file and it's easy job for them usually. Nonetheless, there are many Shibas out there that have seedphrases, private keys, passwords or many other forms because they used Exodus Wallet or some online wallets, paper wallets etc.

I've been through a lot of research and work spent on restoring my wallet on Dogecoin Core. Now I'm sure for many it won't be most suitable or comfortable to do that, since the blockchain of main wallet takes about 70GB of space and tons of time to sync for the first time. Information found here can be still very helpful for you regardless. It might help you restore your wallet in other software as well.

# 2. Getting your Dogecoin Core up to date & sync'ed

That's a pretty difficult one so I will keep it short and point your way to another post that describes it in-depth.

1. Make sure you have the latest version of Dogecoin Core (1.14.3 at the time of writing it)
2. Download recent bootstrap of Dogecoin blockchain to speed up the process (more below)
3. Check wallet connections settings (Settings -> Options -> Network)
4. You can try adding nodes manually through debug console (more below)

So without making this too long, most of the stuff how to do these things and where to download bootstrap from April 2021 you can find already here:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/ms82cn/dogecoin\_blockchain\_20210416/](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/ms82cn/dogecoin_blockchain_20210416/)

# 3. Getting your private key

So most of you probably know that you can't really recover your wallets directly using seedphrase, like it works for many other cryptos. Although some websites with online wallets offer these options and so does Exodus (multi-wallet). Now, you don't need to use them to recover your wallet, just saying that this is where many of them come from and it's safer to not try recovering it online unless that's the original place where you created your wallet. I actually tried recovering mine on [dogechain.info](https://dogechain.info) \- that's probably the only online one I would trust but for some reason my recovery there failed with error, couldn't verify if I have 2FA enabled or something like that. I tried several times and neither worked.

Now, no matter what your seed is (12 word, 15 word, 24 or whatever you used/have), you can convert them to your private key, so exactly what all of them represent, it's just much more convenient to write down words instead of long string of numbers and letters. Now to do that, you can use different tools but most trusted and best I've seen was by iancolman:

[https://github.com/iancoleman/bip39/releases](https://github.com/iancoleman/bip39/releases)

1. Download the latest *bip39-standalone.html*
2. Turn off your internet connection (for extra safety)
3. Open the file you downloaded, change setting to Dogecoin
4. Write there your seedphrase

If you've done everything correctly, scroll down and you will see a list of addresses, paths, public and private keys. All of them belong to your seedphrase technically. Now, most of the time your wallet will be the top one. You can check the addresses and their balances on some dogecoin blockchain explorer just to make sure you're not wasting your time trying to recover empty wallet. Private key is what you need to recover it, that's the most important element and make sure to not share it with anyone and always keep it safe.

# 4. Recovering wallet

This one is pretty easy but not very intuitive if you were to guess or try alone doing it. If your Dogecoin Core if fully sync'ed and running, do this in order:

1. Help -> Debug Window -> Console
2. write command:  
`importprivkey <insert your private key here>`
3. Click enter. It will take some time to verify that (For me it took about 1h).

If your wallet is encrypted please unlock it first:

`walletpassphrase <your password> 500`

# 5. Final comments

If you're lucky and everything was done accordingly, you've just recovered your wallet! It worked for me and I'm sharing this in hope that it works for you too. If you still require further help or have questions, feel free to ask in comments. If this was a helpful solution for you and you want to tip me some doge, send me a private message and I will share my wallet address (every doge counts!)"

Over the past months I have answered across reddit and across Twitter several requests, and I tried to rectify a lot of misinformation. If you have read any of these interactions, I tend to hammer in the idea that Dogecoin has always had a stable and capable development team.

Many people come to this community after having read a couple of articles on major  outlets (CNN's recent one comes to mind, but they are all the same on this topic) where it is always, invariably stated that Dogecoin has no fundamentals, has no use cases, and all the developers have left in 2015. This is certainly a fault on the lack of research of the writer, but as they say, that cat is out of the bag, and it is up to us to fix this misunderstanding. I am the first to get a bit angry when I see these comments, but then I realize the fault is also on our end.

I would thus propose the following:

1. **As a shibe, if you see people spreading this misinformation about the reality of Dogecoin development, please take the time to write a reply explaining how things really stand. Be polite.** People might be lazy and not do proper research, but we cannot act in the same rude way in which other cryptocommunities used to answer to newcomers. So, please answer these misconceptions about the developers whenever you see them on Twitter, on Reddit, on Facebook, or when your favorite YouTuber or journalist perpetuates the mistake.
2. **Would it make sense to update the website to include a small page about the development team of Doge?** Could anyone of the current development team write a statement , discussed before publishing with all current developers, explaining how dogecoin was maintained tirelessly all these years to work as a currency and which we could then share as a reliable source on wikipedia and media? 
3. **Social media: would it make sense to write more frequent updates on the developers' Twitter channel detailing what is being worked on?** Even a couple of updates per week just saying what is going on, to show the work being done, explaining what some of the stuff being done is. I would volunteer to do it, but I have been a lurker for years in this community, I am not a blockchain developer (just a regular web dev), and I would not trust a person with no credentials like me to do it. But anybody that can listen in on the discussions between the developers and write a small report every once in a while could do it?
4. **Underline in all communications that Dogecoin is a grassroots operation, so anybody with the right skills can join the project.** Fork the project on github, follow the discussions, and get coding. Or contribute to an external API, such as the Rosetta API.

Please add to this thread and start helping with this now!"

One, what is Rosetta API and what does it do for dogecoin? Two, is there development needed to list on coinbase or have they just simply not picked it up yet?

As you also likely know, I spend a lot of time attempting to reunite lapsed Shibes with their now life-changing amounts of Doge. There are established recovery paths for most situations, and generally a little reading or simple questions are sufficient.

However, Dough has always been a huge pain in various parts of the anatomy. As a non-standard HD client, the usual repertoire of Bitcoin recovery tools don‚Äôt work, and when it was abandoned, the author posted a recovery tool on the website.

Unfortunately, this tool is patchy at best. Some people have had success. Some have fiddled with the offsets to find the child wallet they needed. Many others however have ended up with lists of thousands of wallets, all empty. And some have simply given up and abandoned their coins.

This has stumped even seasoned programmers (I don‚Äôt count myself among them, my coding days are a dim and distant memory from several lives ago).

As I see it, there are a few issues to address.

* What exactly are the deviations from BIP32?
* Is the seed phrase BIP39-compliant?
* Does the derivation path follow the standard?
* Can used children be identified reliably?
* Are there reliable ways to use existing tools?

And finally, if it comes down to brute-forcing, will an approach such as this work? https://medium.com/@johncantrell97/how-i-checked-over-1-trillion-mnemonics-in-30-hours-to-win-a-bitcoin-635fe051a752

And as a community, we must accept some responsibility for the situation. The client was listed as the official iOS client for a long time before being removed from the website. And I don‚Äôt think being the only iOS client was sufficient justification for this. We could have prevented the harm from occurring in the first place, so we should try and heal the wounds if at all possible."

Background:
Blockchain is a financial instrument. The best blockchain must be build for an economic global model, addressing a form of monetary policy to keep stability and balance for its supply and output. The priority should be finance first then the right code to make it more efficient, not the reverse. It should be flexible and responsive to dynamic global market changes while finding the right balance to mitigate hyperinflation and economic downturn. Understanding global finance requires global monetary policy and other factors such as Quantitative Easing - increasing coins minted, and increments of coins burned. An Ai model should be trained and encompass aforementioned factors as well as others to continue mass adoption and become a global reserve currency. 

Doge needs to move forward from Gen 1 (POW) blockchain architecture and get some cutting edge ai tech. 

Maybe Elon's elite engineers at OpenAi can help with this. üôè



Features: 

True decentralization - Difficulty Hash rate monitored per Geo-location grid. After allotted hash rate in an area has been exceeded (deemed a hot spot), increase the difficulty hash rate for that area. Renders large scale mining farms unprofitable. Thus, incentivizes for an abundancy of smaller miners and to spread out geographically. Can confirm their actual locations through GPS tags and kept anonymous on the network to prevent miners tracing down others for anticompetitive measures.


-Ai tx spam filter - allow 0 fee transactions and can mitigate spam - like gmail spam filter 

-Ai dynamic block size / optimized block speed - increase block size when network is conjested, then shorten block size when network is slow. orders of magnitude faster 

-Ai dynamic block reward - number of new coins minted per block are decided by a total weighted avg of a variety of market factors such as demand, inflation, twitter sentiment, network activity, current news.


-Ai flexible SHA cryptography - quantum attack resistant 

-Ai controlled small increments of token burn - supply vs demand ratio 

-Ai trained model on monetary policy, QE, economic theories, financial law, news, market fluctuations, global gdp, global trade data, production of goods to control the network. 

-GPT3 can provide quarterly financial blockchain reports made public"

However, I keep seeing posts asking for formal organization of Dogecoin or people asking the developers to make changes to Dogecoin (without realizing the negative implications those changes could have) - all in response to Elon Musks tweet. 

Asking the developers questions is fine (I ask them questions all the time) but please stop and think before making a post or reaching out to them. 

Here a few points to consider:

A) Elon musk is not saying that Dogecoin SHOULD have formal organization. He‚Äôs saying it DOESNT have it. That‚Äôs a good thing. 

B) asking for formal organization doesn‚Äôt make sense and counter productive to the point of Cryptocurrency. Cryptocurrency is founded upon decentralized control. Always has been. The control is in the people in the community. Not one person. 

C) Dogecoin is open source. Anyone can work on Dogecoin development if they know how to code and know what they are doing. 

D) The development team has always been working on Dogecoin. Even before Elon Musk. They will continue to do so with or without him. People are only asking about it now because Elon brought it to everyone‚Äôs attention, but the development team has always been very helpful and responding to the community. Just please. Do your research before bringing up a point because odds are - it‚Äôs already been address 1,000 times.

Common things people ask the development team (devs are welcome to reply and clarify any thing if it‚Äôs incorrect) 

1. create a burning system to reduce the supply - already been answered. Not happening. Burning is counter productive anyway. If you want to burn your coins you already can send your coins to a burn address. Stop asking to burn or reduce the supplies of OTHER peoples coins. Not happening 

2. Create a supply cap. Not happening - already been answered. Dogecoin already has a supply cap of 10,000 coins per minute  which turns into 4% yearly inflation rate which is negligible. Having a cap does nothing in terms of the actual value of Dogecoin or bitcoin or practically any other cryptocurrency for that matter at the current moment. The cap only matters once that limit has been reached. The cap for bitcoin doesn‚Äôt happen until 2140. At no point in dogecoins existence has inflation been an issue. Demand is and will continue to be orders higher than any inflation rate. The supply and inflation has already been proven over and over to be a non-issue

3. Transaction speeds and transaction fees. They‚Äôre Working on it - have been for months before Elon‚Äôs tweet

4. Coinbase integration - working on it - have been for months.

5. Anything else - check their GitHub or r/Dogecoindev. They‚Äôve been working on Dogecoin for 8 years. Odds are your question has been answered. If your question hasn‚Äôt been answered THEN consider making a post.

The second is algo - they randomly assign validators so that theoretically only bribes could be used to sway the network (and that would seem in itself unlikely even at 51% attack threshold) - because no one knows who the validators will be in advance.

I was just thinking about how there are two potential use cases for doge - cheaper online transactions, and also travelers who might want to be able to exchange money with each other, or buy things without needing local currency, or being at risk of being robbed (or have currency conversion fees for that matter).

Those conversion and processor fees seriously sting.

Each of these use cases almost needs a software solution. An out of the box, pre-made payment system for direct shopping orders with doge, not through fiat or a third party. And preferably something compatible directly with a popular merchant platform. If someone developed this, a one off fee could be charged, generating profits, without needing to charge for transactions. 

And a way to obtain doge, without needing an exchange, or having an entry barrier. People have reported finding this complicated, having delays to get approved, or just generally not finding it easy enough.   


Perhaps something like dogecoin dex can be that? I'm not sure. But it needs to be easier for folk to get crypto. Regulation has made it complicated. It should be as easy as getting a gift card.

0.077,0.771,0.152,0.9369,"I can't recall seeing much discussion about setting transaction fees based on the age of the outputs being spent. I'm starting to think it could be a great solution that balances reasonable fees while still prevents spam transactions.

I'm imagining tx fee schedule based on the number of confirmations of outputs being spent. It might look something like this:

1 doge <1000 conf  >0.1 doge <10,000 conf > 0.01 doge <100,000 conf

This has benefits of reducing spam since you'd need to hold coins several months before low fees kick in. It places a higher fee burden on high frequency spenders/traders. And it rewards casual users since older outputs are charged the lowest fees.

Since dogecoin has BIP068 enabled, implementing this might even be provided through a checksequenceverify script. This has the added economic encouragement for wallet developers to integrate more advanced scripting capabilities to dogecoin wallets.

Create a new shortcut to the Dogecoin Core client, then right-click select ""Properties"" and add ""-paytxfee=0.01"" to ""Target"". Then run it from that shortcut.

In the user interface for sending coins, you then need to select custom fee, and it will let you use 0.01 as the fee instead of 1."

0.034,0.875,0.091,0.9577,"Dear Dogecoin Developers community,

I am interested in designing a small attachable device to existing payment terminals that will accept DOGE as a payment through NFC on your mobile devices. However, I would like to discuss in details about why? what? how?

&#x200B;

\*Why?\*

With this cryptocurrency transformation going nowadays, more and more online stores are accepting cryptocurrency as a form of payment. The real stores, however, are having hard times. The payment process includes various complicated details such as: setting up the crypto wallet, requesting the payment, navigating through application after scanning the QR code, and many other manual steps that can be automated. For us, in the tech-savvy world, these processes may be neglected, but not for the people that value the time and subconsciously embrace the simplicity. Moreover, the payment cannot be proceeded through NFC, i.e. a way of making it contactless.

&#x200B;

\*What?\*

In the existing market, the major payment manufacturers are VeriFone, Ingenico, CPI, and few more. What I am suggesting is inventing a small payment device that can be either attached to these payment machines, or operate on its own with only one goal of accept cryptocurrencies as a form of payment. The device should be pretty compact, with the size of the USB flash drive(better to be discussed later). Now, once it is connected to the main computer inside the stores, it will:

\-automatically create the wallet for the store owner

\-navigate with the ""cash"" register, so that once the cashier proceeds to the payment stage, the request of ABC Doge will be sent to our device and the customer will use their phone.

This definitely means that the customer needs to have an app that will work with our device.

&#x200B;

\*How?\*

I have experience working with CAD (multiple projects, scientific researches, etc)

Before starting the Product design part, I would like to ask the community of the developers, what else do I need to include within this device. I know the project sounds ""Impossible"", but why not give it a try?

&#x200B;

I am open to any comments and suggestions."

Lets also assumes dogecoin will be one of the coins that will survive and  reaches a crazy value of 8$, 10$ or more.  Wouldn't 1√ê=1√ê makes the doge fees huge then for day to day simple use?  For example if 1√ê=10$ and i buy a cup of coffee with doge which costs 3$, wouldnt that mean i will actualy spent 13$ for it? Or buy something that costs 10$, i will pay double that ammount in doge. Of course buying expensive staff wont really make a big diference compared to what we have now.

If things move in the faster tx direction it would seem that having a lot of nodes at the chain tip would be super important. Worth incentivizing? 

I am thinking about the PoW energy paradox...I understand the criticism to PoS centralization so instead of rewarding as a function of coin balance, why not reward nodes which are fully synced? This will become increasingly difficult and increasingly important. This would incentivize many many more shibes to run good nodes with quality connections and uptime. 

What are the weaknesses here? A bad actor would have to run a buncha nodes to cause trouble ya, but I suppose they wouldn‚Äôt have to own any doge. But potentially many more honest people will be incentivized to do so too. Maybe some involvement of coin balance is necessary to ensure the attacker is disincentivized to successfully attack their own network.

0.05,0.887,0.063,0.2461,"Hello shibes.

As many of you have noticed, other cryptos' blockchain explorers often list, next to some of the top wallets, the name of the exchange holding that wallet. As an example, [https://bitinfocharts.com/top-100-richest-bitcoin-addresses.html](https://bitinfocharts.com/top-100-richest-bitcoin-addresses.html), [https://nanocharts.info/](https://nanocharts.info/), or [https://adaex.org/richlist](https://adaex.org/richlist).

Several times, on reddit and on twitter, I tried to fight against the FUD surrounding the ownership of the top Dogecoin wallets. Most of them are obviously exchange cold/hot wallets, as anybody who has been into crypto for more than a couple of months would be able to recognize.

Unfortunately, also due to the insistence in spreading misinformation of several media outlets and of guys like Hoskinson, people outside the Doge community  keep spreading the lie that Dogecoin is more unfairly distributed than other cryptos.

We have had users investigating and identifying owners of several top wallets in such a way that leaves little space to any doubt. This is the case of the DH5 wallet, for example: [https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/lkwnny/mystery\_solved\_the\_billionaire\_dogecoin\_whale\_aka/](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/lkwnny/mystery_solved_the_billionaire_dogecoin_whale_aka/). Users like u/Fulvio55 have also tracked some hot wallets back to Binance, according to his past posts.

Now, you might  say ours are just ""speculations"" (at least those concerning cold wallets, since hot wallets are easier to track unequivocally back to an exchange through withdrawals and deposits). But as a matter of fact, the ownership of the top wallets shown in bitinfocharts for Bitcoin or for nano in [https://nanocharts.info/](https://nanocharts.info/) (and so on for many other cryptocurrencies) comes from the same kind of speculation  that u/AndreiFromAlberta did in the DH5 thread linked above. **The difference is that for BTC, bitinfocharts has no problem listing that kind of speculation as fact, whereas for Dogecoin they are not doing the same.**

This is a problem for us, because whenever I try to make people understand some of the top wallets cannot be anything but cold/hot wallets for exchanges, I am pointed to lists such as [https://bitinfocharts.com/top-100-richest-bitcoin-addresses.html](https://bitinfocharts.com/top-100-richest-bitcoin-addresses.html), [https://nanocharts.info/](https://nanocharts.info/) as proof that Bitcoin is different in comparison with Doge, whereas the situation is substantially the same (with the added problem that Bitcoin had a substantial amount of coins mined by very few people).

Can we do a community push to collect information about all the top wallets and then ask the major Dogecoin explorers (bitinfocharts, [dogechain.com](https://dogechain.com) [sochain.com](https://sochain.com)) to list the identity of the wallet holders as it is being done for almost any other crypto?

So, we would need to first gather proof for each of the top 20-30 wallets, like Andrei did for the DH5 wallet, and then contact the Dogecoin blockchain explorers to add a note like they do for other exchanges next to each wallet."

I want to pay you $50 usd on dogecoin to assist me and get a running dogecoin core wallet.   I would much prefer to be one of the devs working on the wallets, as that way I'm giving some money for the guys actually working on dogecoin.    


About me and why I'm asking this:   if you look at my history and submitted messages here on reddit, I've been mentioning for months now that I have an older laptop that's been running for nearly 6 years, the only task is been doing for 90% of this time has been to run a core wallet.   

Sometimes i would see 90+ connections and everything was fine, I've uploaded Terabytes of data to the network.   But lately the computers hdd (i think) is starting to fail.   

And if there are more than 20ish connections to my wallet, it somehow can't keep up and loses synchronization. I did some digging and find the lines to reduce maximum capacity so now it holds at 20 connections, and it seems ok.

I tried for a few hours to get one running, but I'm afraid I'm Linux skills are too limited to understand how to get it resolved.   

The hardware: i have a rbpi4 with 32gb microsd, and the Samsung external t5 500gb ssd memory attached to hold the wallet.   


Goal:  have a running core dogecoin wallet on the rbpi, and easy to remember instructions on how to upgrade the wallet as new SW comes out.


Options:    
1) install a Linux based OS, install dogecoin wallet      
2) install some other OS, run dogecoin.    

I want to this only for running the wallet, no other purpose. Like I said I've had it running for 6 years undisturbed, I have no reason to think I can't create a new setup that can run are least another 6-10 years without much maintenance.    

Running the wallet on windows would be great because I know what to do and keep updated easily, but with rbpi i don't know what to do.... Could I run a VM windows and run the wallet inside?    


Anyway best solution, walk me through with it, get it working, and the steps to update when needed.   

Is $50 too much/little? I don't know... Please let me know, but like I said, I'll just ignore any new account, or any account with no track record of actually been helping dogecoin for the past 6 years-6 months.  


And again would love to have one of the devs who have been working with dogecoin for years to help out, that way they get some extra money just to help a random internet person....



P.s. I have no idea if what I wrote sounds like a choosingbeggar of i do please correct me in my ways.

## What Is A Full Node?

A full node is a program that fully validates transactions and blocks. Almost all full nodes also help the network by accepting transactions and blocks from other full nodes, validating those transactions and blocks, and then relaying them to further full nodes.

Most full nodes also serve lightweight clients by allowing them to transmit their transactions to the network and by notifying them when a transaction affects their wallet. If not enough nodes perform this function, clients won't be able to connect through the peer-to-peer network---they'll have to use centralized services instead.

Many people and organizations volunteer to run full nodes using spare computing and bandwidth resources---but more volunteers are needed to allow Dogecoin to continue to grow.  This document describes how you can help and what helping will cost you.

## Costs And Warnings

Running a Dogecoin full node comes with certain costs and can expose you to certain risks. This section will explain those costs and risks so you can decide whether you're able to help the network.

## Special Cases

Miners, businesses, and privacy-conscious users rely on particular behavior from the full nodes they use, so they will often run their own full nodes and take special safety precautions. This document does not cover those precautions---it only describes running a full node to help support the Dogecoin network in general.

## Secure Your Wallet

It's possible and safe to run a full node to support the network and use its wallet to store your Dogecoins, but you must take the same precautions you would when using any Dogecoin wallet.  Please see the [dogecoin core guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/wiki/dogecoincoreguide#wiki_safety_first.21_encrypting_your_wallet) for more information.

## Minimum Requirements

Dogecoin Core full nodes have certain requirements. If you try running a node on weak hardware, it may work---but you'll likely spend more time dealing with issues. If you can meet the following requirements, you'll have an easy-to-use node.

* Desktop or laptop hardware running recent versions of Windows, Mac OS X, or Linux.
* 50 gigabytes of free disk space, accessible at a minimum read/write speed of 100 MB/s.
* 2 gigabytes of memory (RAM)
* A broadband Internet connection with upload speeds of at least 400 kilobits (50 kilobytes) per second
* An unmetered connection, a connection with high upload limits, or a connection you regularly monitor to ensure it doesn't exceed its upload limits.
* 6 hours a day that your full node can be left running. (You can do other things with your computer while running a full node.) More hours would be better, and best of all would be if you can run your node continuously.

## Possible Problems

* Legal: Dogecoin use is prohibited or restricted in some areas.
* Bandwidth limits: Some Internet plans will charge an additional amount for any excess upload bandwidth used that isn't included in the plan. Worse, some providers may terminate your connection without warning because of overuse. We advise that you check whether your Internet connection is subjected to such limitations and monitor your bandwidth use so that you can stop Dogecoin Core before you reach your upload limit.
* Anti-virus: Several people have placed parts of known computer viruses in the Dogecoin block chain. This block chain data can't infect your computer, but some anti-virus programs quarantine the data anyway, making it more difficult to run Dogecoin Core. This problem mostly affects computers running Windows.
* Attack target: Dogecoin Core powers the Dogecoin peer-to-peer network, so people who want to disrupt the network may attack Dogecoin Core users in ways that will affect other things you do with your computer, such as an attack that limits your available download bandwidth.

## Initial Block Download (IBD)

Initial block download refers to the process where nodes synchronize themselves to the network by downloading blocks that are new to them. This will happen when a node is far behind the tip of the best block chain. In the process of IBD, a node does not accept incoming transactions nor request mempool transactions.

If you are trying to set up a new node following the instructions below, you will go through the IBD process at the first run, and it may take a considerable amount of time since a new node has to download the entire block chain (which is roughly 50 gigabytes now). During the download, there could be a high usage for the network and CPU (since the node has to verify the blocks downloaded), and the client will take up an increasing amount of storage space ([reduce storage](#reduce-storage) provides more details on reducing storage).

Before the node finishes IBD, you will not be able to see a new transaction related to your account until the client has caught up to the block containing that transaction. So your wallet may not count new payments/spendings into the balance.

If you are using Dogecoin Core GUI, you can monitor the progress of IBD in the status bar (left bottom corner).

## Linux Instructions

The following instructions describe installing Dogecoin Core using tools available in most mainstream Linux distributions.  We assume you use a Bourne-like shell such as `bash`.

Using any computer, go to the [Dogecoin Core download page](https://dogecoin.com/). Choose the appropriate file for your Linux install (either 32-bit or 64-bit) and download the file. If necessary, move the file to the computer you want to use to run Dogecoin Core.

If you aren't already logged into the computer you want to install Dogecoin on, login now.  Make sure you use an account that can use `su` or `sudo` to install software into directories owned by the root user.

If you logged in graphically, start a terminal.  If you logged in another way, we will assume you're already in a shell.

Locate the file you downloaded and extract it using the `tar` command followed by the argument `xzf` followed by the file name. The argument `xzf` means eXtract the gZipped tar archive File. For example, for a 64-bit tar archive in your current directory, the command is:

    tar xzf dogecoin-1.14.3-x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.gz

This will create the directory `dogecoin-1.14.3` within your current working directory. We will install the contents of its `bin` subdirectory into the `/usr/local/bin` directory using the the `install` command. The install command is part of the GNU coreutils available on nearly every Linux distribution, and the `/usr/local/bin` directory is a standard location for self-installed executables (you may edit the commands below to use a different location).

If you use `sudo` to run commands as root, use the following command line:

    sudo install -m 0755 -o root -g root -t /usr/local/bin dogecoin-1.14.3/bin/*

If you use `su` to run commands as root, use the following command line:

    su -c 'install -m 0755 -o root -g root -t /usr/local/bin dogecoin-1.14.3/bin/*'

*To continue, choose one of the following options*

1. To use Dogecoin Core Graphical User Interface (GUI), proceed to the [Dogecoin Core GUI](#dogecoin-core-gui) section below.
2. To use the Dogecoin Core daemon (Dogecoind), which is useful for programmers and advanced users, proceed to the [Dogecoin Core Daemon](#dogecoin-core-daemon) section below.
3. To use both the GUI and the daemon, read both the [GUI instructions](#dogecoin-core-gui) and the [daemon instructions](#dogecoin-core-daemon). Note that you can't run both the GUI and the daemon at the same time using the same configuration directory.

## Dogecoin Core GUI

In order to use Dogecoin Core GUI, you will need several libraries installed. All of them should be available in all major recently-released Linux distributions, but they may not be installed on your computer yet. To determine whether you're missing any libraries, open a terminal (if you haven't already) and run the command `/usr/local/bin/dogecoin-qt` to start Dogecoin Core GUI.

If all the required libraries are installed, Dogecoin Core will start. If a required library is missing, an error message similar to the following message will be displayed:

    /usr/local/bin/dogecoin-qt: error while loading shared libraries: libQtGui.so.4: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

Search your distribution's package database for the missing file missing and install package containing that file.  Then re-run `/usr/local/bin/dogecoin-qt` to see if it's missing another file. Repeat until Dogecoin Core GUI starts.

You will be prompted to choose a directory to store the Dogecoin block chain and your wallet.  Unless you have a separate partition or drive you want to use, click *Ok* to use the default.

Dogecoin Core GUI will begin to download the block chain.  This step will take at least several days, and it may take much more time on a slow Internet connection or with a slow computer.  During the download, Dogecoin Core will use a significant part of your connection bandwidth.  You can stop Dogecoin Core at any time by closing it; it will resume from the point where it stopped the next time you start it.

After download is complete, you may use Dogecoin Core as your wallet or you can just let it run to help support the Dogecoin network.

*Optional: Start Your Node At Login*

Starting your node automatically each time you login to your computer makes it easy for you to contribute to the network. The easiest way to do this is to tell Dogecoin Core GUI to start at login. This only works in desktop environments that support the [autostart specification](http://standards.freedesktop.org/autostart-spec/autostart-spec-latest.html#startup), such as Gnome, KDE, and Unity.

While running Dogecoin Core GUI, open the Settings menu and choose Options.  On the Main tab, click *Start Dogecoin on system login*.  Click the Ok button to save the new settings.

The next time you login to your desktop, Dogecoin Core GUI should be automatically started as an icon in the tray.

If Dogecoin Core GUI does not automatically start, you may need to add it to an `.xinit` or `.xsession` file as [described here](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Guide_to_X11/Starting_Sessions).

You have now completed installing Dogecoin Core.

To support the Dogecoin network, you also need to allow incoming connections. Please read the [Network Configuration](#network-configuration) section for details.

## Dogecoin Core Daemon

If you're logged in as an administrative user with sudo access, you may log out. The steps in this section should be performed as the user you want to run Dogecoin Core.  (This can be a locked account used only by Dogecoin Core.)

Type the following command:

    dogecoind -daemon

It will print a message that Dogecoin Core is starting.  To interact with Dogecoin Core daemon, you will use the command `dogecoin-cli` (Dogecoin command line interface).

Note: it may take up to several minutes for Dogecoin Core to start, during which it will display the following message whenever you use dogecoin-cli:

    error: {""code"":-28,""message"":""Verifying blocks...""}

After it starts, you may find the following commands useful for basic interaction with your node: `getblockchaininfo`, `getnetworkinfo`, `getnettotals`, `getwalletinfo`, `stop`, and `help`.

For example, to safely stop your node, run the following command:

    dogecoin-cli stop

When Dogecoin Core daemon first starts, it will begin to download the block chain. This step will take at least several days, and it may take much more time on a slow Internet connection or with a slow computer. During the download, Dogecoin Core will use a significant part of your connection bandwidth. You can stop Dogecoin Core at any time using the `stop` command; it will resume from the point where it stopped the next time you start it.

*Optional: Start Your Node At Boot*

Starting your node automatically each time your computer boots makes it easy for you to contribute to the network.  The easiest way to do this is to start Dogecoin Core daemon from your crontab.  To edit your crontab on most distributions, run the following command:

    crontab -e

Scroll to the bottom of the file displayed and add the following line:

    @reboot dogecoind -daemon

Save the file and exit; the updated crontab file will be installed for you. On most distributions, this will cause Dogecoin Core daemon to be automatically started each time your reboot your computer.

If you're a expert system administrator and want to use an init script instead, see [the init scripts directory in Dogecoin Core's source tree](https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin/blob/0b46a40ed125d7bf4b5a485b91350bc8bdc48fc8/doc/init.md).

You have now completed installing Dogecoin Core.

To support the Dogecoin network, you also need to allow incoming connections. Please read the [Network Configuration](#network-configuration) section for details.

## Windows Instructions

## Windows 10

Go to the [Dogecoin Core download page](https://dogecoin.com/) and download the Dogecoin Core installer to your desktop.

After downloading the file to your desktop or your Downloads folder (`C:\Users\<YOUR USER NAME>\Downloads`), run it by double-clicking its icon. Windows will ask you to confirm that you want to run it. Click Yes and the Dogecoin installer will start.  It's a typical Windows installer, and it will guide you through the decisions you need to make about where to install Dogecoin Core.

*To continue, choose one of the following options*

1. If you want to use the Dogecoin Core Graphical User Interface (GUI), proceed to the [Dogecoin Core GUI](#windows-10-dogecoin-core-gui) section below.
2. If you want to use the Dogecoin Core daemon (Dogecoind), which is useful for programmers and advanced users, proceed to the [Dogecoin Core Daemon](#windows-10-dogecoin-core-daemon) section below.
3. If you want to use both the GUI and the daemon, read both the [GUI instructions](#windows-10-dogecoin-core-gui) and the [daemon instructions](#windows-10-dogecoin-core-daemon). Note that you can't run both the GUI and the daemon at the same time using the same configuration directory.

## Windows 10 Dogecoin Core GUI

Press the Windows key and start typing ""Dogecoin"".  When the Dogecoin Core icon appears (as shown below), click on it.

https://preview.redd.it/gbamjerewxn61.png?width=500&format=png&auto=webp&s=ed76cdfc2cf0fd3e541ecc5aa637b55f30813b22

You will be prompted to choose a directory to store the Dogecoin block chain and your wallet.  Unless you have a separate partition or drive you want to use, click Ok to use the default.

Your firewall may block Dogecoin Core from making outbound connections. It's safe to allow Dogecoin Core to use all networks. (Note: you will still need to configure inbound connections as described later in the [Network Configuration](#network-configuration) section.)

Dogecoin Core GUI will begin to download the block chain.  This step will take at least several days, and it may take much more time on a slow Internet connection or with a slow computer.  During the download, Dogecoin Core will use a significant part of your connection bandwidth.  You can stop Dogecoin Core at any time by closing it; it will resume from the point where it stopped the next time you start it.

After download is complete, you may use Dogecoin Core as your wallet or you can just let it run to help support the Dogecoin network.

*Optional: Start Your Node At Login*

Starting your node automatically each time you login to your computer makes it easy for you to contribute to the network. The easiest way to do this is to tell Dogecoin Core GUI to start at login.

While running Dogecoin Core GUI, open the Settings menu and choose Options.  On the Main tab, click *Start Dogecoin on system login*.  Click the Ok button to save the new settings.

The next time you login to your desktop, Dogecoin Core GUI will be automatically started minimized in the task bar.

**Warning**: to prevent data corruption, do not force shutdown of your computer from the Windows shutdown screen when you have Dogecoin Core running.

You have now completed installing Dogecoin Core.

To support the Dogecoin network, you also need to allow incoming connections. Please read the [Network Configuration](#network-configuration) section for details.

## Windows 10 Dogecoin Core Daemon

To start Dogecoin Core daemon, first open a command window: press the Windows key and type ""cmd"".  Choose the option labeled ""Command Prompt"".

https://preview.redd.it/kjvfmf1jwxn61.png?width=497&format=png&auto=webp&s=931c13bfbe08b28699f91182e3406ce5ec43a20b

If you installed Dogecoin Core into the default directory, type the following at the command prompt:

    C:\Program Files\Dogecoin\daemon\dogecoind

Dogecoin Core daemon should start. To interact with Dogecoin Core daemon, you will use the command `dogecoin-cli` (Dogecoin command line interface).  If you installed Dogecoin Core into the default location, type the following at the command prompt to see whether it works:

    C:\Program Files\Dogecoin\daemon\dogecoin-cli getblockchaininfo

Note: it may take up to several minutes for Dogecoin Core to start, during which it will display the following message whenever you use dogecoin-cli:

    error: {""code"":-28,""message"":""Verifying blocks...""}

After it starts, you may find the following commands useful for basic interaction with your node: `getblockchaininfo`, `getnetworkinfo`, `getnettotals`, `getwalletinfo`, `stop`, and `help`.

For example, to safely stop your node, run the following command:

    C:\Program Files\Dogecoin\daemon\dogecoin-cli stop

When Dogecoin Core daemon first starts, it will begin to download the block chain. This step will take at least several days, and it may take much more time on a slow Internet connection or with a slow computer. During the download, Dogecoin Core will use a significant part of your connection bandwidth.

*Optional: Start Your Node At Boot*

Starting your node automatically each time your computer boots makes it easy for you to contribute to the network.  The easiest way to do this is to start Dogecoin Core daemon when you login to your computer.

Start File Explorer and go to:

    C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\StartUp

Right-click on the File Explorer window and choose New, then Text file. Name the file `start_dogecoind.bat`. Then right-click on it and choose Open in Notepad (or whatever editor you prefer). Copy and paste the following line into the file.

    C:\Program Files\Dogecoin\daemon\dogecoind

(If you installed Dogecoin Core in a non-default directory, use that directory path instead.)

Save the file. The next time you login to your computer, Dogecoin Core daemon will be automatically started.

**Warning**: to prevent data corruption, do not force shutdown of your computer from the Windows shutdown screen when you have Dogecoin Core running.

You have now completed installing Dogecoin Core.

You have now completed installing Dogecoin Core.

To support the Dogecoin network, you also need to allow incoming connections. Please read the [Network Configuration](#network-configuration) section for details.

## Upgrading Dogecoin Core

If you are running an older version, shut it down. Wait until it has completely shut down (which might take a few minutes for older versions), then run the installer (on Windows) or just copy over /Applications/Dogecoin-Qt (on Mac) or dogecoind/dogecoin-qt (on Linux).

The blockchain and wallet files in the data directory are compatible between versions so there is no requirement to make any changes to the data directory when upgrading. Occasionally the format of those files changes, but the new Dogecoin Core version will include code that automatically upgrades the files to the new format so no manual intervention is required.

Sometimes upgrade of the blockchain data files from very old versions to the new versions is not supported. In those cases it may be necessary to redownload the blockchain. Check the release notes of the new version if you are planning to upgrade from a very old version.

Sometimes downgrade is not possible because of changes to the data files. Again, check the release notes for the new version if you are planning to downgrade.

## Network Configuration

If you want to support the Dogecoin network, you must allow inbound connections.

When Dogecoin Core starts, it establishes 8 outbound connections to other full nodes so it can download the latest blocks and transactions. If you just want to use your full node as a wallet, you don't need more than these 8 connections---but if you want to support lightweight clients and other full nodes on the network, you must allow inbound connections.

Servers connected directly to the Internet usually don't require any special configuration.  You can use the testing instructions below to confirm your server-based node accepts inbound connections.

Home connections are usually filtered by a router or modem. Dogecoin Core will request your router automatically configure itself to allow inbound connections to Dogecoin's port, port 22556. Unfortunately many routers don't allow automatic configuration, so you must manually configure your router. You may also need to configure your firewall to allow inbound connections to port 22556. Please see the following subsections for details.

## Testing Connections

For confirmation that you accept inbound connections, you can use Dogecoin Core. Dogecoin Core can't tell you directly whether you allow inbound connections, but it can tell you whether or not you currently have any inbound connections. If your node has been online for at least 30 minutes, it should normally have inbound connections. If want to check your peer info using Dogecoin Core, choose the appropriate instructions below:

* [Peer info in Dogecoin Core GUI](#gui-peer-info)
* [Peer info in Dogecoin Core daemon](#daemon-peer-info)

## GUI Peer Info

In the bottom right corner of the Dogecoin Core GUI are several icons. If you hover over the network nodes icon, it will tell you how many connections you have. The icon won't be fully filled in until you have more than 8 active connections, which only happens if inbound connections are allowed.

https://preview.redd.it/74o5wxqkwxn61.png?width=565&format=png&auto=webp&s=d5de61e9e0ebd407b41db89b84b785e0508208a4

For confirmation, you can go to the Help menu, choose Debug Window, and open the Information tab. In the Network section, it will tell you exactly how many inbound connections you have. If the number is greater than zero, then inbound connections are allowed.

https://preview.redd.it/c0xn83gmwxn61.png?width=643&format=png&auto=webp&s=31ddc53868dd5ceb810036b7131cce0d0b4b54ff

If you don't have inbound connections, please read the instructions for [enabling inbound connections.](#enabling-connections)

## Daemon Peer Info

The `getconnectioncount` command will tell you how many connections you have. If you have more than 8 connections, inbound connections are allowed. For example:

    $ dogecoin-cli getconnectioncount
    10

For confirmation, you can use the `getpeerinfo` command to get information about all of your peers.  Each peer's details will include an `inbound` field set to true if the connection is inbound.  If you have any inbound connections, then inbound connections are allowed.

If you don't have inbound connections, please read instructions for [enabling inbound connections.](#enabling-connections)

## Enabling Connections

If Dogecoin Core can't automatically configure your router to open port 22556, you will need to manually configure your router.  We've tried to make the following instructions generic enough to cover most router models; if you need specific help with your router, please ask for help on a tech support site such as [SuperUser](http://superuser.com/).

Enabling inbound connections requires two steps, plus an extra third step for firewall users:

1. Giving your computer a static (unchanging) internal IP address by configuring the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) on your router.
2. Forwarding inbound connections from the Internet through your router to your computer where Dogecoin Core can process them.
3. Configuring your firewall to allow inbound connections. This step mainly applies to Windows users, as Mac OS X and most Linuxes do not enable a firewall by default.

## Configuring DHCP

In order for your router to direct incoming port 22556 connections to your computer, it needs to know your computer's internal IP address. However, routers usually give computers dynamic IP addresses that change frequently, so we need to ensure your router always gives your computer the same internal IP address.

Start by logging into your router's administration interface.  Most routers can be configured using one of the following URLs, so keep clicking links until you find one that works.  If none work, consult your router's manual.

* [http://192.168.0.1](http://192.168.0.1) (some Linksys/Cisco models)
* [http://192.168.1.1](http://192.168.1.1) (some D-Link/Netgear models)
* [http://192.168.2.1](http://192.168.2.1) (some Belkin/SMC models)
* [http://192.168.123.254](http://192.168.123.254) (some US Robotics models)
* [http://10.0.1.1](http://10.0.1.1) (some Apple models)

Upon connecting, you will probably be prompted for a username and password.  If you configured a password, enter it now.  If not, the [Router Passwords site](http://www.routerpasswords.com/) provides a database of known default username and password pairs.

After logging in, you want to search your router's menus for options related to DHCP, the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol.  These options may also be called Address Reservation.

In the reservation configuration, some routers will display a list of computers and devices currently connected to your network, and then let you select a device to make its current IP address permanent:

https://preview.redd.it/ggapzehowxn61.png?width=895&format=png&auto=webp&s=676ed168f3131475109e6a8ce2938de6728887da

If that's the case, find the computer running Dogecoin Core in the list, select it, and add it to the list of reserved addresses. Make a note of its current IP address---we'll use the address in the next section.

Other routers require a more manual configuration. For these routers, you will need to look up the fixed address (MAC address) for your computer's network card and add it to the list. This operation differs by operating system:

* **Windows 7 & 8:** Press Win-R (Windows key plus the R key) to open the Run dialog. Type `cmd` to open the console. Type `ipconfig /all` and find the result that best matches your connection---usually a wireless connection. Look for a line that starts with ""Physical Address"" and contains a value like this:
* **Linux:** open a terminal and type `ifconfig`. Find the result that best matches your connection---a result starting with `wlan` indicates a wireless connection. Find the field that starts with `HWaddr` and copy the immediately following field that looks like 01:23:45:67:89:ab. Use that value in the instructions below.
* **Mac OS X:** open a terminal and type `ifconfig`. Find the result that best matches your connection---a result starting with `en1` usually indicates a wireless connection. Find the field that starts with `ether:` and copy the immediately following field that looks like 01:23:45:67:89:ab. Use that value in the instructions below.

Once you have the MAC address, you can fill it into to your router's manual DHCP assignment table, as illustrated below. Also choose an IP address and make a note of it for the instructions in the next subsection. After entering this information, click the Add or Save button.

https://preview.redd.it/mmv3nglpwxn61.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=86002dc0893424cf851f04e48622c622b4449bc5

Then reboot your computer to ensure it gets assigned the address you selected and proceed to the Port Forwarding instructions below.

## Port Forwarding

For this step, you need to know the local IP address of the computer running Dogecoin Core. You should have this information from configuring the DHCP assignment table in the subsection above.

Login to your router using the same steps described near the top of the [DHCP subsection](#configuring-dhcp).  Look for an option called Port Forwarding, Port Assignment, or anything with ""Port"" in its name.  On some routers, this option is buried in an Applications & Gaming menu.

The port forwarding settings should allow you to map an external port on your router to the ""internal port"" of a device on your network as shown in the screenshot below.

https://preview.redd.it/mnhl1uiqwxn61.png?width=893&format=png&auto=webp&s=feba8220695638974d749ae5000e9cbe4b13de2c

Both the external port and the internal port should be 22556 for Dogecoin. Make sure the IP address you enter is the same one you configured in the previous subsection.

After filling in the details for the mapping, save the entry. You should not need to restart anything. Start Dogecoin Core (if you haven't already) and follow the [Testing Connections](#testing-connections) instructions to test your connection.

If you still can't connect and you use a firewall, you probably need to change y"

GPU's inherently use less power.  There are algorithms like EThash ETChash, Kapow, RandomX and many others that favor GPU's and resist ASIC's

CPU's inherently use even less power than GPU's.  There is an algorithm called YesPower that has proven over multiple years to resist both GPU's and ASIC's and the creator said he would release new versions if ASIC's or GPU's could ever mine it.  This in particular would be great as every dogecoin fan could mine dogecoin themselves on any laptop or PC.

So these are options to reduce energy usage without going proof of stake and favoring the rich and loosing network security.  Also making blocks come faster, like 30 seconds instead of 1 minute, and also increasing blocksize will reduce the energy per transaction."

I, like many others, first heard about Dogecoin from the Joe Rogan podcast in December of 2020 when Elon Musk was a guest. since then I have been following the Dogecoin community mainly for amusement. This leads me to the title question of How can I help or contribute to the future development of Doge. I have been questioning what I could do (as a novice and new person to coding in general) to learn more and potentially contribute to the future development of Doge. Are there currently Avenues that would allow someone with no Knowledge about coding or Doge to start learning more? What recommendations would someone who's been working as a Doge developer give to an outsider who wants to learn more? These are the types of questions that keep filling my head. The Doge community (from what I've seen) is one of, if not the most supportive online communities I've come across, and I would love to be able to contribute in some way.

my understanding is doge goal was to always be an accepted usable currency that can be traded for fiat money and even possibly take the place of fiat money. 

to me - that means the value would sit around the price of fiat money until fiat is no longer used and X amount of doge is traded for 1 pizza. 

currently it's easy to understand the deflation of doge and how much it deflates yearly. which makes it a viable option for a tradeable currency. Why,  cause you don't buy deflationary items with an inflationary object. 


so my question here is -- are the developers still streamlining a goal to make dogecoin a tradeable currency? or have we changed that goal to become an inflationary coin like etherum and btc?"

0.055,0.877,0.068,0.8584,"I'm flattered that some of you think I am Elon because our ideas for improving the coin have been similar.  Reading this will prove I am not, but we are similar types of people.  We are both Scientists, Engineers, Business owners, and primarily Designers.  We are both idealists.  In one of the companies I worked for, I have actually worked with Tesla engineers as our customer on developing a product for them.  I have never seen a company that was as adamant of us developing a product outside our collective comfort zone as Tesla was.  Since we were not willing to ""cut corners"" as we saw them, it made it very difficult.  I left the company before we completed the design process, but I am curious how it played out.

But doing the impossible is what Elon is all about.  I have worked on and built electric cars including being on electric car race teams.  I can tell you that in the field an electric car that goes 0-60 in 3.2 seconds, 11.8 second quarter mile, and 350 mile range for $40,000 that any customer can buy and is road legal, is nothing short of impossible.  Elon does the impossible regularly, and is used to doing it.  Unless I am personally standing on the landing pad watching a rocket de-orbit and see it land right in front of me, I will continue to believe that landing a rocket with it's rocket engines alone from space is impossible.

So Elon will achieve what he is looking for in a coin, with or without us.  And I can tell you that if it is without us, Doge will go back to $0.01.  His ask is not even that impossible, and is what the community has been pushing towards anyway.

100x fee reduction is something all of us have been wanting.  Heck I think it should be reduced 200x.  Currently Bitcoin Cash has a 1000x cheaper fee than we do, and they are not having any spam problems and their blocks are not full.  Litecoin also has well under 1 cent min transaction fee.  Same with Bitcoin SV and Digibyte.  And unlike these coins, we never have to rely on fees to pay miners since we have a tail emission. This goal is trivial to meet.

10x Blocksize is also not a problem at all.  Many coins have max blocksize this big or bigger with no issues.  Our blocks are basically empty right now.  So obviously we haven't even needed a max blocksize to keep blockchain growth under control.  Average Blocksize will regulate itself which has been shown in all coins including bitcoin, as it took years for them to fill up their first block.

10x reduced blocktime is not that far fetched.  As we know it it is basically impossible for a Proof of Work coin to do 6 second blocktimes with current network effects and technology.  But 10 seconds is in the realm of possibility, and heck, 15 second blocktimes are downright practical; Digibyte has a 15 second blocktime and their orphan rate is currently well under 10%.  In terms of this metric, I propose we take it slow and start with a 30 second blocktime and assess our orphan rate and also syncing metrics.  Our coin will probably struggle achieving very fast blocktimes more so than other coins because we are merged mined and our nonce is routinely in other coins (not just litecoin, we are merge mined with all scrypt coins) blockchains.  Also segwit will likely hurt syncing as well as we will now have 3 places that our data can be; other blockchains for the nonce, transaction blocks for the transactions, and signature blocks for signatures - all of which have to be synced.

Anyway, why not try?  These are all things the community wanted anyway.  We can do the first 2 with no problem, and can work towards the 3rd.  I'm sure Elon would be willing to deploy some satellite and/or fiber nodes to help us achieve the 3rd, and wouldn't that be some cool PR?

Also leaders of Dogecoin need to be customer focused.  Elon is a large customer - one who has caused our price to rise more than any other.  The rest of the community are all customers too, and if we look at them with disdain and judge their motives, that is the farthest thing from customer service we can do.  Of course we have some guiding principles we cannot revoke such as Proof of Work, a coin with our own blockchain (not to become a token), Layer-1 on-chain scaling, and a Tail Emission (un-capped supply).  But when it comes to a roadmap on improving the coin, we should be listening to our customers."

The individual who cleaned could also leave a¬†NFT of before and after could be placed¬†in the app for proof of work.

This could be a great way to make people take care of their¬†neighborhood and help improve our streets.

It could be sponsored by equipment suppliers¬†to help make this possible. We would need to have a whole rendering of our planet with GPS tracking capability (for example¬†as done by Super world or Pok√©mon Go).

Limit wallet size to say 1 420 069 coins to prevent whales from being able to manipulate the price of the coin

Describe Preferred Solution
Reduce maximum wallet size to 1 420 069

Describe Alternatives
Asking external parties like SEC to prevent market manipulation, which they won't do.

Whales need to buy a lot of coins in order to manipulate the price down by dumping the coins that they bought, if we have a decentralised exchange like metamask where you can swap BTC for DOGE to a maximum wallet size of say 1 420 069 it solves the problem of price volatility to a massive extent. If the volatility is reduced, adoption will follow like a tsunami. Elon will ove this idea because it deals with the price manipulation.

DOGE would absolutely stand out as the peoples coin and solicit mass adoption if the price increase was natural/organic.

Please look at this issue again, getting this sorted is MASSIVE!

Feel free to use my idea to anybody reading this.

Feel free to scrutinize or add to this.

&#x200B;

Idea 1:

Twitter-like Social media platform:

&#x200B;

* Instead of likes or upvotes we tip 1/100 of a dogecoin
* To get around the constant transaction fees, 
* Do what robin hood already does and make it to where you own a tokenized form of dogecoin.
* All the coins go into one wallet and you only pay transaction fees when you deposit/withdraw from the platform.
* Making a post should cost 2/100 of a dogecoin. (sent to app wallet)
* Making a comment should cost 1/100 of a dogecoin. (Sent to the poster)
* If too many comments are sent by one person, incrementally increase the cost of commenting by 2/100 and have a cooldown timer of 3min per increment. To prevent bots.
* Maybe adding a cap on the amount of dogecoin (\~$1000) per account so people can't be too reckless (optional)
* Guarantee their data isn't being sold or tracked.
* People get rewarded for good memes.
* Also good for donations to charity organizations.

&#x200B;

Idea 2:

Gaming platform that is synced with the social media platform

Make gaming tournaments with a 0.01-1 dogecoin entry fee.

For a cashflow, have a $5 per month membership thing..

Heavily restrict the amount for betting on poker and 21 to avoid negative press.

&#x200B;

* Poker
* 21
* Tetris 99
* Fantasy football
* Among us
* Halo combat evolution
* Fall guys
* Fortnite
* Bet on sport events (Probably lots of legal ramifications and can't add)
* Bet on elections (Probably lots of legal ramifications and can't add) 

&#x200B;

Also sponsor current gaming tournaments with huge communities like:

* super smash ultimate
* Counterstrike

0.005,0.906,0.089,0.9731,"Since i got a request in DM to explain a bit more about how to verify the trusted build process, and this is something that is requested sporadically, I thought I'd just share this with everyone for visibility.

Gitian is a process invented by the bittorrent team that ensures that no code was injected maliciously. Every step of the build process is hashed and can be reproduced by anyone and then compared to signatures from multiple builders. It is a LOT of work to set it up, but worth it if you want to be sure that the devs did not lie to you.

If you just want to check if your binary is the signed one, and you're on, say windows 64-bit, you take one of the signer's lists that were published and dig out the sha256, eg: https://github.com/dogecoin/gitian.sigs/blob/master/1.14.2-win/langerhans/dogecoin-win-1.14-build.assert#L8

The lists of hashes are signed with PGP keys that you can find in https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin/tree/master/contrib/gitian-keys

the dir tree structure of https://github.com/dogecoin/gitian.sigs is: `<version>-<platform>/signer/` so you'd normally take one of the signers for a release and check if your binary matches the hash.

On linux/osx (and possibly WSL but I have never tested that) you can then automagically compare asserts and sigs for a release by cloning https://github.com/devrandom/gitian-builder and then:

1. Getting the descriptors from https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin
2. Cloning https://github.com/dogecoin/gitian.sigs
3. running `gverify`

so let's say you put it all in one place, you do something like:

    git clone https://github.com/devrandom/gitian-builder
    git clone https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin
    git clone https://github.com/dogecoin/gitian.sigs
    pushd dogecoin
    git checkout v1.14.3
    popd

and then you can check all v1.14.3 binary signatures with something like:

    for platform in osx linux win; do 
      gitian-builder/bin/gverify -r 1.14.3-$platform \
        --destination ./gitian.sigs/ \
        ./dogecoin/contrib/gitian-descriptors/gitian-$platform.yml;
    done

If you really want to be 100% sure, you can run the entire build process yourself and compare your output with the published outputs, using the script i wrote for 1.14.3: https://gist.github.com/patricklodder/fcffff8af0df78bdfb2957581c7368e5"
0.094,0.784,0.122,0.8824,"I work on credit ratings and I have some insight on the current risks Doge and crypto in general face. From what I‚Äôve learned and seeing so far, unfortunately, until a coin has a risk that could be considered as ‚Äúinvestment grade‚Äù, I don‚Äôt see big institutional investors going all in. In credit rating is pretty straightforward: if you have a BBB rating or above, your bond can be considered investment grade, meaning there‚Äôs some certainty that the security will pay holders its capital and interests in time, thus, attracting institutional investors to jump in. Below BBB-, your securities are riskier since there‚Äôs not relative certainty that you‚Äôll pay your money back with the promised interest, scaring away institutional investors. In this wildly volatile crypto market, investors and the community in general need some perspective on where crypto and Doge are heading to assess investment with more powerful insights. As uncertainty is at its highest due to the pandemic, the consequential world economic crisis we‚Äôre facing, added to social and political unrest in many parts of the world, we need to stand here and have as much certainty as possible. So, how do we create some certainty out of this chaotic multi-systemic uncertainty? In my opinion, as most things over the last 200+ years, with research and development, paired with education. The first idea I might give you is creating some sort of research and education foundation that has the long term goal of overcoming all the current risks and issues that cryptos faces that hinder mass adoption, scare away institutional investors and worry governments, central banks and regulators. This foundation would also have the task of educating and informing all its stakeholders regarding the current risks involved on investing in Doge, the challenges ahead, the milestones achieved, how to help Doge adoption and ‚Äúevangelisation‚Äù regarding its value as currency and investment. Thus, it should invest on research and provide an open source of knowledge and insights that ultimately help investors and the community on decision making regarding the extent of risk that best suits their needs.

The other fundamental role that this foundation would have is leading a ‚Äúgreen crypto world‚Äù, setting up a date for having a zero emission crypto market by 20XX. Again, research, education, information would be fundamental"

As we've had several discussions about Coinbase integration lately and one of the requirements from Coinbase is that there is a maintained Rosetta API implementation for every asset they list, complying with this requirement is good for Dogecoin. This also further improves commonalities with other coins that implemented this API, which means that development towards this can serve much more than just the Coinbase requirement.

Here's how it works: You create notes, and people can comment on those notes (if you make them public). Notes, users, and comments all have their own Dogecoin wallets. When someone deposits money into a Note, the money ""trickles down"" into constructive conversations that unfold in the comments below. 

For example: if someone drops $100 into a note, and ten people make comments, maybe they'd all get varying amounts of cash. The recipients can then either withdraw or deposit money into other notes to draw attention to them / support creators. 

A more concrete example would be to imagine Reddit awards, but where they're actually dogecoin, and they can be converted into cash. And a piece of each award automatically trickles down into high-quality, thoughtful engagement.

\- **A big part of the current doge inflation / fees could be used to give out as basic income / doge dividend instead of just burning them for POW. This would help all shibes on this planet to have enough food to live and helps greatly for a more fair participation in the global economy.**

\- **Since you get more basic income / universal dividend the more you participate in the doge economy, using doge is encouraged very much, which helps adoption of doge to make doge the new number one currency on this lovely planet earth.**

**- Especially projects / enterprises which behave according to the doge ethics would benefit from the economic incentives, which would help to transform the economy to be more fair and environmental friendly**

**- Additionally decentralized tree planting projects could be supported, which would help to save this beautiful planet earth.**

IN SHORT:

**- Social justice through a Basic Income / Universal Dividend**

**- ENVIROMENTAL JUSTICE: Through supporting tree planting projects and helping eco friendly enterprises**

**- DECENTRALIZATION OF POWER: Through using a decentralized blockchain and using liquid democracy techniques**

**THIS WOULD MAKE DOGECOIN TO THE CURRENCY FROM THE PEOPLE FOR THE PEOPLE**

**Everyone would have it in the hand to increase his basic income / universal dividend and at the same time the universal dividend of all other shibes through using doge. The more we use doge, the higher the basic income / universal dividend would be.**

0.07,0.785,0.145,0.9791,"So this is a bit of a far away discussion, for many many decades into the future.   


One problem with most crypto currency is it's FAR too deflationary to be an economic driver. Excess monetary supply results in run away inflation, but too little can lead to *run away deflation* that can be just as disastrous, historically speaking. For example the silver shortage that is thought to have contributed to the collapse of the Ming dynasty.   


Dogecoin is much more suited to this balance of supply and demand with it's supply rate, however, in say 50 to 100 years, dogecoins supply rate may become theoretically too low (as it approaches 0%). So I propose a sort of opposite bitcoin halving - '**Dogecoin Doubling**'.   


When supply increase mathematically falls under let's say 1% per annum (or some other figure, take your pick I'm just guessing), you double the mining rewards. This way it never falls too far below the average economic growth of 2%, and thus shouldn't have the potential for a deflationary spiral due to a wide mismatch of supply and demand.    


It would be best to set a set level of supply increase at which this occurs, so that it was not open to outside influence or central party manipulation. Setting it below average economic growth allows for some natural value appreciation once the market is fully saturated (as opposed to the value depreciation of fiat).   


Now, I know this is a very very future thing, and well, not at all something we are are certain would become an issue. I simply propose it now, so that the idea is floated for future generations of developers, miners and hodlers - should dogecoin ever become a substantial part of the global economy."

For the past week I've been working on creating an awesome online dogecoin wallet called DogeVault. I finished checking over the code today so decided to release it and show you guys first.

There's two existing online wallets out at the moment, dogewallet.com which kinda sucks as it's been having problems with downtime. Their site isn't all too great or secure as well. The other is instadoge.net which is a public wallet using an old script which isn't secure and has bugs.

**You can see screenshots of the site here**

**And if you love it, try it out for yourself at the link below, it's completely free to use.**

I know how wary people can be of online wallets, but they can be useful if you're getting into doge or if you're away from your computer.

Test it out with small amounts if you like, or use it to store as much doge as you want. 

I have lots more amazing features planned and will be adding them over Christmas and the New Year. Security features will be coming first, like two-step-auth using your mobile or SMS to login/send payments.

Please let me know how you like it, if you find any bugs (there shouldn't be any), and what features you'd like to see in the site.

Thanks!"

0.046,0.767,0.186,0.9914,"One of the challenges with real world transactions using dogecoin right now is that there is no good way to handle delays in the bank-and-forth that normally happens with a transaction. Take the following example:

Problem 1: Shipping/purchase problem

1. Buyer purchases a new bike from Amazon for $1500
2. Amazon verifies that purchasing power equals $1500 for transaction
3. Amazon cannot actually charge the buyer until the bike ships per legal regulations
4. Amazon goes to ship bike, but its 2am and the person getting it ready isn't privvy to the seller's contact info to complete the transaction (transaction fails?)

Problem 2: Recurring payments/e-Bills

1. Buyer agrees to take possession of a case of cleaning supplies every month or to pay an eBill up to certain limit each month
2. Buyer wants to use crypto
3. Seller wants to charge buyer as agreed using subscription pricing or to pay unspecified amount of an ebill, but buyer is now required to enter the transaction whereas historically using a bank or credit card this would not be the case.

It seems to me that the solution would be to create custodian accounts that allow two parties to transact rapidly, and both parties can verify the state of the transaction. A purchase would put money into the custodian account, but the amount doesn't deposit to the merchant until product is shipped. If certain conditions are not met, the custodian would return the amount to the original owner. For recurring purchases, I guess you would just put in enough to cover multiple months of purchases, like a bank.

Is this where smart contracts come in, or is there another solution already designed for this? I'm curious how others have worked out this problem as entities like Amazon consider payments in crypto."

[The road to 1.14](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/b46qki/dev_report_from_electric_capital_dogecoin_ranked/ej5i1cg/)

A. Release Dogecoin 1.14 in early fall after a mid summer beta release. Currently math is being done in the structuring of just how to apply our specific code along with their changes. There is a functional outline as we speak working with the preupdate required changes that need to be made before simply updating. We are skipping ahead a bit in releases, and making sure it is all there is vastly important. While we follow Bitcoin we also have a lot of fairly complicated Dogecoin specific things. Re: Aux, Digishield at the forefront which have to get special attention with each release and update.

B. Multidoge and the android wallet will be getting updated either as core is updating or just following. This will include slight ui changes and perhaps some tinkering with the functionality in an attempt to bring slightly more user stability for users who are using these devices incorrectly. I will add here that the idea behind a new wallet is also in talks, however in what manner it will be or form it will come I cannot say.

C. CATE is currently in thoughts to be getting more dedicated work to it. As to where this goes or how it pans out, I make no guarantees, simply stating that it is a thought at the moment.

**Done** ~~D. We are looking into either assisting or bringing back online Dogeparty which one of the core devs adopted for a while last year, and I personally paid for. There are some people interested in bringing the promised token exchange online that the original developers for the project failed to actually follow through with. They have reached out and to my knowledge conversations are being had.~~ [Dogeparty Dogecoin recovery tool](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/6fh391/dogeparty_key_recovery_tool/)

**Ongoing**~~E. They are maintaining their activity with the bounties and assisting with information, resources and anything they can. For as staunchly that it comes across we are unwilling to work with new technology, we are involved whenever asked for assorted projects around the coin. We wish to continue this supportive nature across all of our communities and assorted developers. It has been our way of giving back all along, and we do not intend to change it.

**Done** ~~F. Segwit is being put into the wallet, but the functionality is not being activated. Segwit has been a topic in Dogecoin for over a year now, and all the developers have pretty much stated very clearly as to why they do not feel the need for it. What people I think fail to understand is that we have looked into it, we have tested with it a bit and looked into just what we gain from it. Using the data gathered from our hugely successful test of our blockchain not that long ago, and learned the limits where we place the benchmarks. The outcome was little to nothing is bettered, making it not something nor a direction we need to go currently. Especially not given it would be a fork with no gain.~~ [Sewit addressed here](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoindev/comments/7tnys3/rpc_tests_what_are_they_why_do_we_care_can_you/).

**Ongoing**~~G. We are going to continue to assist the services and platforms around Dogecoin, in hopes of bringing our userbase a more secure and stable interaction across their entire Dogecoin experience. Services, exchanges and platforms have issues both known in private and some more public ones; we have every intention of continuing to provide support and advice to them all because helping them helps out community at large. I will note that this goes for everything from api help to funds recovery, we have a decent group of developers in our assorted communities; helping has always been a thing.

**In Progress** H. We see the losses that not only this community but the communities at large have been faced with. While we cannot force anyone to use certain services, or handle their funds in specific ways; we are looking at the options as to how to lessen the occurrences of loss both from theft and users oopsing their information. This will most likely come in the form of a multi-communal dedicated educational push. We are looking at code changes to help make it easier for users to manage and maintain their important information as well.

**Done**~~I. The entire month of December is as of this moment a blackout time for the core developers. In all the time with the coin they have had very little actual, 100% time off in full for the three of them. They had a short summer break which they all ended up actually working through last year on coin related stuff. I am aware that people assume simply because they are not here on reddit posting, or that github is not being active; that there is no work being done. This could not be further from the actual truth of the matter. Baring anything breaking it is my fullest intention to gift them this month as a thank you from everyone across Dogecoin.~~ 

J. Such moon, many wow, glitter and pink

^(Migrated from an external post to it's own posting for easier tracking.)

**A - Update - 1.14 is currently awaiting final merger and inclusion with communal feedback relating to the process of branch migration. [Github proposal](https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin/pull/1587)**

**D - Edit - Given there currently exists no external usage for Dogeparty created tokens, bringing the entire platform back online seems pointless. Especially with newer technology out there.**

**F - Edit - Segwit was interesting not only from a code perspective but from a functional view. Testing, prodding and trying things out we found that there were dire issues relating to having it turned on. From where we stand at the moment the network is healthy enough and processing transactions in a manner that does not require the changes that are included with Segwit. We understand that it is a fun buzzword for many however will note that our process, the testers, the users were included in this discussion ongoing. You can see ""The road to 1.14"" which goes into Segwit with more specifics.**

**H - Edit - Over the next few days continuing on from last week there will be ever more speaking about the security and cautions the users need to take when using Dogecoins. Reddit, IRC, Tele, Discord and Slack communities are involved in this, rolling out slowly to facebook and twitter more so**

**I - Edit - I did try to get them to take the month off, however I settled for two days. This is better than previous years so I hope it does them well.**"
0.041,0.883,0.076,0.616,"Idea for making transactions more efficient, and faster, whilst keeping the network somewhat the same.

Just spitballing here. 50c instead of 1c transaction fees as a target for transactions on the extra layer 2 network (same low fees on the main network).

Validators would split fees by staked percentage. Something like how liquidity pooling works, yeah?

That way, the PoS would be optional, keep the mainnet pure PoW, secure, decentralized with no major changes needed. But some of the txn volume would be offloaded onto the settlement.

Would likely also give fast enough txn's for point of sale, and add to scalability. This would also probably give higher APY than conventional proof of stake, making it incentivized better.

Should be far more usable than lightening. Not entirely sure if this is a fully fleshed out or viable idea. "

* Max is working on the RPC tests for 1.14. These are mostly currently set to Bitcoin values and need updating to match Dogecoin, but sometimes this work exposes bugs that can be a lot harder to identify through regular testing.
* Patrick is working on continuous integration (Travis), which will help us identify any regressions from later work on 1.14
* I'm gathering feedback on first draft of a document making the case for Dogecoin, and tomorrow back to raising PRs

1.14-probably-broken has proved actually quite stable, and I'm beginning to roll it onto further infrastructure. Expect to see the first production network 1.14 node tomorrow.

Patrick reports that services he works with have had problems with Bitcoin Core 0.15 not tracking unspent outputs correctly, to the point that they're reverting to 0.14. That may impact our 1.15 release; at the moment it looks like I'll take 1.15 up to beta stage for forward compatibility testing of 1.14, but it won't be formally released. I'm continuing to rebase 1.14 work on Bitcoin Core 0.15 so we have it ready to clean up and test with, and once 1.14 ships I'll do the same for Bitcoin Core 0.16 to make Dogecoin Core 1.16.

A formal alpha primarily needs the RPC test work to be completed as that will shake out any remaining major snags, and it should then just be a matter of QA stages.

0.027,0.864,0.109,0.9818,"The lightning network is actually a very simple concept.  You create a contract with another party where you both stake say 1,000 dogecoins and that gets approved through the blockchain via being included in a standard block.  Now say your lightning partner owes you 100 doge.  You both sign off on it and now you have 1,100 doge and your partner has 900.  You can keep doing this until one of you runs out of doge.  It can be done one-way too, say you stake 1,000 doge to your amazon account (kind of like buying a giftcard).

Once you run out of balance, you would need to make a new contract and that needs to get broadcast to the blockchain.  You also need to settle the old contract on the blockchain.  So it takes an on-chain transaction to start the pair, and an on-chain transaction to end the pair. Rinse and repeat. [https://medium.com/coinmonks/the-lightning-network-how-to-install-and-hopefully-make-money-6e3058e3fa7c](https://medium.com/coinmonks/the-lightning-network-how-to-install-and-hopefully-make-money-6e3058e3fa7c)

Why do you need to stake the money first?  Because imagine you are in contracts with 2 people and you sign your coins to 2 of them at once.  This is called double spending.  And unless you have a set amount of coins staked to the entity that cannot be spent elsewhere, you can double spend.

The problem with this is most people aren't in relationships where they want to lock away a large amount of money with only 1 trading partner.  It might work well for huge corporations like amazon, but do you still want to commit a large amount of money to trade only with amazon?  If you want to buy something on Ebay and all your money is locked in an amazon pair, then you would have to ask amazon's permission to break the contract.  They would probably charge a fee.

Now imagine a small business you visit rarely.  You wouldn't want to lock money away into that trading pair.  Same with peer to peer payments.

So would it increase speed and reduce congestion on the network?  Perhaps, but only for certain, I would say niche, use cases.  Also we have to realize that people generally don't like locking money to be traded with only one party, so it really won't be a popular solution to the masses.  It's really no different than buying gift cards.

***What are the alternatives?***

Reducing blocktime for faster confirmations, and increasing blocksize maximum (does not effect coin reward) will allow for there to be cheaper and faster transactions where you don't have to lock away any coins to only one person or company.  In addition, these ""alternatives"" can be done alongside the lightning network to improve dogecoin for everyone, not just people in staked trading pairs."

I really liked the idea of ""Doge"", because you know that feeling you get whenever something has evidently been ""dying to be made fun of"", but you weren't consciously aware of this, until somebody does it seemingly effortlessly, and you go ""damn, that's a good one."" ,

Like the first time I heard the word hipster in 2011, and suddenly a giant trend I wasn't really done becoming aware of, can succinctly fit into one new pejorative somebody smarter than me came up with.

even back in 2013, in that moment, bitcoin was already deserving of this kind of parody, to me anyway.and I guess objectively, because everybody espousing it as the one true god, though largely vindicated, still isn't as vindicated as if they'd just bought doge, starting from the same period lmao. 12/2013

Anyway, that's why I bought doge, I figured, this will go up because it's funny, and the more it goes up the funnier it gets, and the funnier it gets the more people talk and the more they talk the more it goes up and the ..... etc. etc. etc.

So I decided I was sure it'd not go down, from the short term anyway, cause it was new, and I include this because it's probably important to know why somebody would ever spend $530 on 5.3 million doge (attempt to) , even though now days it seems like the best Idea ever, I assure you at the time it was crazy.

on Decemeber 11th I tried to buy 5 million doge from a guy on reddit, paypal was less than keen on this, and over the course of an hour on the phone with them, and skype with him, they blocked anything I could think to try and get them to let me spend my own money, blocked my atttempts, told me to reset password, didn't work, signed into my sisters paypal, didn't work, my mothers, didn't work etc. all denied.

finally I had to give up, but I had managed to purchase 300,000 doge, for $30, at the beginning of that, before paypal froze me out.

A couple days later, I hit the guy up again, and bought 3,000,000  (for $500, doge was up) using a money card of some kind, I bought at wal-mart, and phoned him the back of / password for.

Then I got really sick, with the flu, and on christmas day when some hack happened, I for whatever reason, asssumed this affected me, and wrote them all off as stolen, in feb 2021, with doge in the news and crypto going nuts, I decided to double check, and sure enough, I found the 300,000 from the night I tried to buy 5,000,000.

But I can't find the 3,000,000 I bought after this, which is odd, because if anything, you'd think there's a better chance of finding the later one, than earlier, especially cause I bought it from I belieev the same person, and he showed me how to get dogecoin core, so why would I set that up, definitively have 300,000 doge in it, and then use something totally different 3-5 days later,

my theory right now, based on old screens of my desktop, is that I for whatever reason, had downloaded dogecoin core twice, and somehow used the second application, the second time, and I'm not able to find this instance of it, nor the directory where the wallet.dat file is stored. I read somewhere that in unix dogecore or btc core can sometimes use a different path /root/something something , as opposed to (i was on mac) /user/Application\_Support/Dogecoin/wallet.dat

is there a chance having downloaded it once already, the second one used a dif path like that?

&#x200B;

or any other ideas that might help?

but yeah that's it, buying that many doge back then , and then believing it was stolen for w.e reason, having protected me from selling early like I would've done, is a stupid and lucky thing that happened to me, and I'm more than happy to pay it forward, and make it a stupid a lucky thing that happened to you too, for helping me find it.

1. I'm currently working on a project involving DOGE and looking for a *mature* thin SPV node I can use to connect to DOGE peers. **Any hints would be appreciated.**
2. If my search ends without success, I'll ultimately start developing an SPV client myself. Not the end of the world, as I'm familiar enough with Bitcoins technicalities to not get blocked too much. I'd just prefer not to reinvent the wheel and stay productive. **I'd appreciate any hints on resources, tutorials, and similar that decrease the barrier of entry on the SPV topic.** It would be a shame to ignore existing resources others worked so hard to write or collect.
3. In case of #2 I'm additionally considering to wrap the node in a REST or websocket API and make it available to the community for free. I obviously know about my personal use case for this, but **would love to hear about yours and to gauge if there's a demand and to estimate load/cost.**"

To start with, we're looking at https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4100 , so that's fairly meaty set of changes. It touches the mining protocol, which is where things get problematic, though. First of all, they're replacing the mining system in Bitcoin. Apply those same changes to Dogecoin, and it breaks. Adapt it to Scrpyt, and you're closer, but there are design differences in Scrypt (the same differences that were meant to make it ASIC resistant) that mean it can't be used the same way too.

Secondly, when the RPC ""getwork"" call went, it left ""getworkaux"" hanging, so there's a decision to be made on whether we hybridize Bitcoin's code to keep getworkaux functioning, or rip it out. In the end we've taken the decision to remove getworkaux, as everyone (in theory) should be using getauxblock instead.

Then... there's subtleties in differences between SHA2 and Scrypt. Again, Scrypt is a lot slower, and targets much higher, so the optimisations in the miner are subtly incompatible. It works well enough to pass basic testing, but in terms of performance on one specific test network is suddenly 10x slower. So we end up tweaking the values used to better match Dogecoin.

Now... we're definitely moving towards automation. There's 900-ish patches left, which at the current rate would take us through to summer. I've been working on tools to automatically determine how to apply patches from Bitcoin and automate as much of that process as possible, so all we require human intervention for is code review afterwards. Hopefully that will also let us expand the number of developers available for reviewing the code, which is the main time sink right now.

What I tried so far:

* Re-installed the wallet, and using only the nodes listed on the official Dogecoin announcement page at bitcointalk.org
* Restored blockchain from a 6 week old local backup
* Completely synced blockchain from scratch into the empty Dogecoin folder


But, no matter what, sync stopped at block 186741.

....Hear me out....this is for fun and ideas...none of this is an immediate serious suggestion....

My hypothesis is something along the lines of....a long, fair, and widely accessible coin distribution is the most important factor benefitting a crypto currency‚Äôs public adoption. I believe that giving away 10,000 Doge per minute to the public (instead of as block reward) would have tremendous positive impact on the currency‚Äôs value and public adoption, counter to conventional capped supply approaches. 

I like that doge is uncapped. I think maintaining the supply of fresh coin provides a unique opportunity to √ê.O.G.E. and further solidify doge‚Äôs role as the people‚Äôs coin. As it stands today no Doge hodler benefits financially from the block reward anyway. So if consensus and security can (eventually?) be had without a large PoW block reward, how would Doge continue its minting? Traditional staking rewards lead to centralization....instead....what‚Äôs the Shibetobiest thing that could possibly be done with those 10,000 doge per minute? .....**Give the 10,000 coins per minute away for free.** 

This idea hikes it‚Äôs leg and pisses all over the fire hydrant that is hyper-deflationary-moon-coin-rug-pulling.

Here‚Äôs my non-dev, idiot populist vision...y‚Äôall chime in please: 

*Assume doge is low energy, low/0 fee, fast transaction time.... pos, DAG, whatever works and doesn‚Äôt require paying miners. I dunno I‚Äôm an idiot. I just know some cryptos are doing it. 

*Maintain 10,000 doge per minute distributed as follows:

*25% rewarded equally to all Nodes operating at the chain tip or equivalent. 

*25% rewarded to charities which Doge hodlers can delegate to from their wallets. 

*10% public faucet (many low payouts, spam resistant maybe tiny PoW or captcha or something)

*10% geography based faucets (see wenano app) to ensure doge is spread worldwide. Users would be able to claim Doge if they were within a certain physical distance. 

*10% staking reward for doge hodlers

*10% development bounties 

*10% public lottery accessible to anyone who can prove they‚Äôre signed up in good faith (financially meaningful payout size). 

I think this provides several ways to reach more citizens of the world. I think everyone with a smart phone could own some doge, even if they didn‚Äôt have funds or access to buy. I think that kind of adoption would lead to many many positive growth opportunities for doge and, counter-intuitively, would be good for coin value. 

I realize the enormous shitload of work it would be to accomplished, but let‚Äôs ignore that for now and poke holes in the general idea.

0.044,0.835,0.122,0.996,"Didn't get much movement on /r/dogecoin, so thought I'd post about it here.

After the recent whoooopsie with DogeAPI and a bit of mucking about with WowDoge (cute, but a 106mb log file in <24 hours filled with ping/pong data is not on) I decided to get off my bum and get an Electrum Doge port done. Also, everyone else seems to be all talk no action with this.

Site will be at https://electrum-doge.org, repos are listed below. Everything is about 90% complete (he said unrealistically) and is ready for initial testing!

**Why is Electrum important?**

The wallet is *deterministic*. What that means is that every new address/change address is generated from a seed, so your entire wallet and every new address you use can be recovered from that seed. No need to backup anything, as long as you have that seed!

(Technical side-bar: if you import private keys in WIF format they are obviously non-deterministic, and will not be recovered from the seed. However, as you already have the private key for those addresses somewhere, you should be saving them anyway).

Electrum's seed is 12 words that it generates at the outset. That's it, nothing else needed. No more backing up your wallet.dat or anything complicated. Neither MultiDoge nor WowDoge are deterministic, and with the issues coming out of the woodwork with MultiBit (change addresses with no privkeys!) I would not feel safe using a fork of it at this juncture.

The Electrum client works on Android, OS X, Windows, and Linux!

**Where are we at?**

Thanks to Pooler's hard work, a lot of the pain points (python scrypt code, for eg.) have been taken care of. There are some known issues with watch addresses that are being fixed, and a few nuances, but the code is ready for initial tests.

I have segregated out a dedi box from one of my clusters for use as a primary server, and I've spun up a VPS as a secondary server. The database has built and the server is available and operational.

Android is a bit broken/difficult (in upstream Electrum), but a new client called Kivvy is being worked on. We will have Kivvy-Doge in the Play store once that reaches readiness:)

**Got screenshots?**

Sure, [here](http://i.imgur.com/JRQCFxa.png), [here](http://i.imgur.com/pzNDJo5.png), and [here](http://i.imgur.com/TlH26wV.png)!

**What do you need?**

- Got a VPS/dedicated box and want to host a semi-permanent server? PM me. You'll be able to advertise in your server banner and put a donation address in, not that anyone actually clicks the Console tab to see what they're connected to;) In preparation you may want to get dogecoind running on the box - you'll need to include ""txindex=1"" in your dogecoin.conf, and will have to run dogecoind -reindex till its caught up, after which you can run it in normal daemon mode. Full instructions for Ubuntu 12.04 LTS will be available, although Arch/Gentoo should be reasonably easy to get going.

- Know python? Good - the Electrum interface is horrible, I'd love to clean it up but my qt knowledge...she is no good. The exchange rates plugin has also been pushed out till I have time to work on it, so anyone able to assist with that would be greatly appreciated. There's also a bit of documentation that needs to be looked at, because dang is that stuff out-dated. Hit me up here/in pm/on IRC.

- I'll also need a handful of testers who are happy to get dirty. I'd like a mix of Windows, OS X, Linux, and Android users, but please only participate at this stage if you're at least a little familiar with python and dependencies, and are happy to muck about in terminal/the command prompt. We will need general testers VERY soon, so don't worry, we're not excluding anyone:)

This should get you going on OS X and Linux. Windows will be trickier, but there's lots of info in the readme and other docs."
0.012,0.834,0.155,0.9858,"**The goal:**  

Right now I'm seeing multiple moderators of subreddits looking for a way to integrate or do something with dogecoins for their sub. Here's an idea that can be applied to any subreddit:  

**The idea:**
Subreddits that are up for it could have a resident bot. One that will collect all the dogetips send to it's account within 24 hours and then send the total collected amount to whichever user has the top submission in that subreddit.  

**The plan:**  

-Have a 'Topdoge' bot script  
-Moderators can create an account that runs on that script  
-Explain the deal in the sidebar  
-Users can send dogecoins to the bot  
-After 24hours bot transfers all accumulated dogecoins to top ranked submission. And announces it in the comment section!   
-HUrrah! I mean, Woof!  

**What's the point?:**  
This is a way for subreddits to incentivise contributions if they wish to do so.   

**Who is this for?  **
People who love the subreddit but want to see more activity in their community. People who want to reward those that bring them good stuff without knowing in advance who that might be. 

**TLDR** Spreading the love by allowing communities to set rewards for their top contributers *in advance*  

I have no experience with writing scripts. However, I do believe this one isn't overly complex. Woahdude is already interested:

     keep hash(block[m0+m\*counter] + t) in m_base_nodes  

for each node in n_base_nodes  
     node = hash(node+tx)

for each node in m_base_nodes  
     node = hash(node+tx)

build tree ntree from n_base_nodes  
build tree mtree from m_base_nodes

ms = t % 1024  
msrg = ms % 64 + 1  

mnode = hash(radiogatun(mtree.root,1024-ms bit position,ms bytes long,msrg bits word))  
nnode = radiogatun(ntree.root,0 bit position, hash_length bytes long, 64-msrg bits word)

build tree k from ntree, mtree, mnode, nnode

return(k[nnode[nnode[0]]])

-----
this could only feasibly be done by having the full blockchain on hand (needs a large storage disk), and memory-wise this takes around 3-10 MB to process the tree depending on luck (needs large amounts of memory), and the radiogatun cipher is like scrypt in that it has variations (not a completely static algorithm). All these properties I feel help mitigate ASIC development, as they would need lots of memory, even more memory, and hella more gates than a Scrypt ASIC (64 radiogatun variations x 1024 different lengths x 1024 different positions, plus 13 unique algorithms, all in one ASIC).

But for normal computers, this doesn't take too much. Given that Scrypt uses 1024 iterations of SHA-256 (I could be wrong) my 56kH/s that I get with Scrypt mining means 56MH/s in SHA256, which might translate to around 30MH/s for all the algorithms considered um I have no idea what I'm talking about. But my point is, even with the cheapest of computers processing blocks this way shouldn't take more time than we do waiting for the blocks to arrive, since the era of 256KB memory computers has been long gone.

Of course, this is me talking out of my ass, I came up with it in about 1 hour, you're free to take only whatever you want from it or ignore it. I just wanted to help, and I figured this is probably to the limit of which I can help and I do indeed want to help as much as I can.

edit: added a need to keep all base nodes intact (or spend more time calculating them)

also it might get to the point where the blockchain is too much for even normal computers to fit the whole tree in so maybe add a limit of 500,000 blocks or something? idk"

0.026,0.933,0.041,0.5357,"Hello all,

I wanted to share an idea that I was thinking about a little after 420pm today.

It takes computing power to mine cryptocurrency. So, what if there was an app to mine dogecoin that only used a fraction of someones phone, but collectively it equals a lot. If a 100 phones were trying to mine at the same time it could equal maybe 1 mining rig (haven't ran numbers). So maybe it could pool 100 phones into one node. Now scale that up, so everyone with the dogecoin mining app on there phones would be dedicating a tiny fraction of their phones computing power. The amount of computing power you select would then translate into how much you receive as a reward. 

The app would run in the background so there wouldn't need to be any intervention from the user. 

I'm not sure if this has been tried before (or if it's even possible), but let me know what you think."
0.034,0.868,0.098,0.9348,"The Dogecoin Core 1.14.0 through 1.14.3 payouts have now been processed.

Many thanks to everyone who has contributed to these releases between January 2018 and February 2021; you‚Äôre all incredibly appreciated. These contributions enabled Dogecoin‚Äôs network to stay secure through times of relatively low public interest. 

Consistent with previous payout rounds, payouts are done in 2 tiers: major and minor, where each tier is defined by the amount and/or importance of code contributions that made it into the releases (i.e. have not been reversed.) 5 contributors had 10 or more contributions and one contribution ([#1676](https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin/pull/1676)) had such an impact (it fixed the performance of the entire Dogecoin network by a factor 20) that it was deemed of enough importance to be awarded a major tier payout.

Contributors that exclusively provided trivial fixes to code comments and documentation have been filtered out, to disincentivize commit spam.

As a result, six major contributors have each received 335,000 DOGE, and nine minor contributors have received 55,000 DOGE each. One payout has been requested to be delayed pending tax advice.

To preserve privacy, we will only list the addresses that payouts were made to.

0.039,0.836,0.126,0.9246,"We've just released a new version of Dogecoin Core, which you can [download from Github](https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin/releases/tag/v1.14.3). This is a minor update that includes important performance improvements. It is a strongly recommended update for everyone.

This release can be installed over an existing 1.14 installation seamlessly, without the need for uninstallation, re-indexation or re-download. Simply shut down your running Dogecoin-QT or dogecoind, perform the installation and restart your node.

The two most important improvements are:

# Improve synchronization speed

Significantly improves the speed at which a node can upload blocks, by removing expensive integrity checks that were performed each time a block is sent to another node. When a block is received and during rescans of the locally stored blockchain, the checks are still performed.

# Reduce default mempool expiry time

Reduces the default time that transactions are cached in the mempool from 336 hours to 24 hours. This default setting can be overridden with the -mempoolexpiry parameter by individual node operators to a value (expressed in hours) that makes the most sense for the use cases the node serves.

For the technical details, please read [the full release notes](https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin/blob/v1.14.3/doc/release-notes.md) on Github."
0.039,0.904,0.057,0.6656,"So recently developers have been pushing for Segwit activation.  This would be a major release.  One that is contentious because it implies that we are following the failed path of BTC to scale without a hard fork.  Lightning has been ""in the works"" for over 4 years.  The fact is lighting totally does work, it just doesn't work in the way it is being promised, so it hasn't been launched fully.  See my post about why: [https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoindev/comments/mxmpic/why\_lightning\_network\_will\_probably\_never\_work\_as/](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoindev/comments/mxmpic/why_lightning_network_will_probably_never_work_as/)

So the thing is developers only get paid for major releases.  It has been 5 years since a major release.  There is roughly $6.5 million dollars in the dogecoin dev fund.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoindev/comments/mirqyb/the\_developer\_tipjar\_fund/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=ios\_app&utm\_name=iossmf](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoindev/comments/mirqyb/the_developer_tipjar_fund/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)

So there is a big incentive for devs to rush a major release of something that isn't needed nor wanted.  The community wants more TPS (transactions per second) and faster confirmations, none of which segwit will accomplish.  The community also wants reduction of the min transaction fee from 1 doge to 0.01 doge.  But that won't get the devs paid, so they are incentivized to make unnecessary changes instead.

So why don't we allow devs to get paid for minor releases?  Dogecoin really doesn't need too much work, and maintaining it should be a task worthy of getting paid for.  This would let the devs feel at ease that they can make small fixes the community is asking for and get paid, instead of pushing out something that no one asked for.

While we will still maintain the highest level of quality in the repo, I think this community can benefit from openness, which is the theme of this promising future currency, at least in an educational capacity.

1. It will address half the new comments given the large influx on here (""How can I help?"")
2. If there are further questions due to the sheer amount of people we helped install the environment, we can splinter off into something like r/dogecoinDevStarter

I think we should prepare the high quality coders of the future, even if it may be a seed sowed now that is reaped a year or two into the future. I argue this is what differentiates this community from the other gatekeeping ones.

I've made a 5 minute video here simply pointing people to the right place.

I can continue this series if we as a community think this is a good idea. The video above ideally would have gone more in depth but loom has a 5-min limit, and it's late here but just wanted to churn out something (I can do a retake, just vetting this idea first; I'm aware the content is embarrassingly simple/seemingly useless to those already remotely in the know). Future videos can go through: navigating the file hierarchy, how the code works (mini decentralized ledger series), how to edit the code, how to submit a PR, and contribute actively and with high quality.

https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/pe2s7w/project_nidzer0_doge_in_every_pocket/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share

Duration: 
24hr

Goal: 
Observe performance of u/sodogetip (DOGE tip bot) within r/dogecoin.

Procedure: 
-Using the ""+/u/sodogetip 1 doge verify"" command; enable command as a reply as much as possible, as quickly as possible using a dedicated thread.
-Start with 300 DOGE. 
-Record and report all findings.

Results:
-Sucessful command exicution rate peaked at 9 commands per minute.
- Inital command error, ""1doge"" used instead of ""1 doge"". This error was found after ~20 tip attempts, these were deleted and updated avoiding duplication.
- Test required deviation from the control environment due to lack of user activity. Testing was moved to the general sub to interact with more users.
-Rate of successful transaction was dramatically impacted due to the large percentage of unregistered users.
- Found command does not work in chats.
Data:
- ~300 commands executed (rounded down from 312 for error allowance).
- 82 verification notifications.
- Approximate successful tip percentage 27%.
-Typical sucessful command to verification receipt time 40 seconds.

Observations:
-Inital usage instructions were difficult to locate; once found, usage was generally painless. 
-Large amount of users were suspicious of command activity; two users became offended after tipping occurred.
-No errors observed with command execution.
-3 instances of post limitation due to exceeding Reddit's activity limit.¬† 
-Initial deposit posted within a few minutes from source, subsequent deposit was successful after 15<>30 minutes.

Recommendations:
- +Balance command could show both current balance and balance after pending tips.
- Basic ""what is"" and ""how to"" explination on bot profile to make it more user friendly.
- Mention tip bot somewhere visible on sub to raise awareness and lower suspicions.
- Don't allow users to post additional tips that could cause pending tips to fault. (To avoid the awkward.)
- Condition resources to expedite expansion to multiple platforms, this would spread functionality and allow for a rapid increase in coin circulation.

Abstracts:
- The usefulness of the bot exceeds face value, aside from seeing who does/doesn't have an active bot wallet (if you see value in that), the act of posting a command summons the bot whom could then post confirming a successful tip. This could in theory triple the comment activity in the sub if every post/comment/reply was tipped. This, of course, would draw the attention of the entities watching activity.
- Wallets with 1 doge are unable to move said doge (due to the ""on chain"" transaction fee), on a large enough scale this would lower the volatility of DOGE in general. This would also allow the value of this coins to appriciate naturally leaving joy to those who remember it later.
- Although 1 DOGE = 1 DOGE, the acceptance value of 1 DOGE = ~0.273 DOGE based on this experiment. This corrilation was far closer to the market value (in USD) than I had originally anticipated. 

Follow-up hypothesis:
More tipping = Higher value
Given the magnitude of the subject, and the fact that the mods here were totally righteous in not banning me for spamming tips, I will plan to repeat this experiment in the near future to confirm my findings."
0.046,0.794,0.16,0.9959,"Bit of an odd update this week, but as the issue is currently highly visible, it seems a good time to say this:

Do not use the accounting system in the reference client for anything important.

If you're not using RPC (the commands listed under https://en.bitcoin.it/w/index.php?title=Original_Bitcoin_client/API_calls_list&oldid=48664 ), this probably won't mean much to you, and you can probably safely ignore this post.

While I'm not aware of the full details of the emergency migration of Moolah's platform from V1 to V2, I do know that the accounting system in the reference client was part of the problem with V1. This isn't a Dogecoin-specific matter, this is something we've inherited from Bitcoin Core. The accounting system has a lot of limitations, and the opinion from the Bitcoin Core developers is that it's better to simply remove it ( https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/3816 ) than trying to fix it.

There's no timescale for removing the functionality yet, but you can expect that in time it will be cut out of the client. If you're already using the accounting system for an existing service, please start working on extracting transaction data to your own database, and developing an accounting system from there.

If you're considering writing a new service, please do not attempt to use the integrated accounting system.

If anyone wants to write a framework for extracting transaction data regularly and synchronising it into a database, and running accounting from that database, I believe many would be incredibly grateful.

Beyond that; a 1.7.2 client beta should be out essentially as soon as we get enough developers into a room together to agree it's ready. This brings in a huge number of bug fixes, and will be highly recommended (but still not required) for all users currently on the 1.6 client.

Lastly, we're starting to see UI mockups showing up; the development team are focusing on keeping the reference client minimal, and personally I hope to reduce the interaction with the wallet, not add more to it. Payment protocol will help with this, and ideally I'm hoping we can develop a protocol to allow sites to request addresses from the wallet automatically (without a cut & paste step). Less is definitely more here, especially as any added features increase the amount of code in which subtle security issues can potentially arise.

Others are of course welcome to fork the reference client and extend it. My preferred option would be to consider a stand-alone ""Social dashboard"" application, if there's definitely a desire to do this, although most of the options listed would work just as well from an HTML 5 website IMHO.

Next couple of weeks are going to be crazy busy my end, so don't panic if you don't hear from me before August. I'll be around, as will the other devs, just perhaps a little quieter."

I like The Joke and want participate. I bought some coins and tried to use wallet.
There is no wallet for iOS(and I couldn't google why?) so
I started from multidoge wallet from official site.
Launched, got address, transfered coins from exchange to it and never got synced because it is stuck at ""Connecting 0 peers"" which I believe old issue based on github issues and tricks with custom peers setup(which didn't work in my case).

I exported private key and downloaded latest dogecoin-core.
To ""restore wallet"" I had to find debug console, read one-lined help and import key just to receive output ""NULL"" which I don't know is okay or not(and won't know until sync complete).
And now waiting for sync 7 years behind.
This part of the joke is not funny at all guys. I don't know about other users but as a senior backend developer I feel confused about the whole situation. Dogecoin has to be friendly, easy and kind.

tldr
Entry curve for dogecoin operating is disastrous and this is what have to be enhanced first to make doge widely available and user friendly.

0.022,0.802,0.176,0.9962,"Hi!

A year ago I reserved some DOGE to tip exceptional, non-commercial content that furthers Dogecoin education. I was planning to tip those things on reddit that were so good that I could do 20 bigger tips, and make people have a bit more than just a beer or 2. Now... after a 100x price increase, I can suddenly tip a whole lot more content but I also don't have time to go over everything the communities create, because the sum of all people interacting with Dogecoin has grown at least as much as the price. Which is great by the way! Go shibes!!! Over the past year I've tried to get some help towards setting things up a couple of times but that hasn't worked out, so I'm doing this differently now:


**I'm looking to hire a web dev shibe for a small HTML job, so that I can run a website that describes the fund, shows the payouts and where people can nominate content to be curated.** I need a single responsive HTML page, without any framework code except bootstrap CSS or equivalent, just to-the-point HTML and images, and ***zero (!!!)*** javascript - I will personally take care of that, is faster than line-by-line review. 

[The mockup of what I envision it to be like can be found here](https://cloudflare-ipfs.com/ipfs/QmdgetnbCBhf1fa5q1MhRVQiWYdgLJmjAQxJfhzwTWEArm) - but this is just the general outline that I quickly mocked up, and I'm fully open to creativity; I'm good as long as the result looks ""professionally comic sans"" and I need it to be dark-mode friendly because otherwise I can't look at my own site. If you're interested, please DM me with some examples of (similar) work you have done in the past, and the amount of DOGE you'd like to charge for this. I'll award the job by Thursday.


^(PS: I know a lot of people are looking for ways to contribute to causes, but please note that this is a privately funded initiative - by me personally - and I will not accept any 3rd party contributions at this time, simply because I lack a legal framework for that, but I may change this in the future depending on the success of the fund.)"

I know that it took me a few days to get the task completed, checking in every few hours to see that little progress had been made. At times, I thought it had crashed on me. As it currently stands, the Dogecoin Core data folders stand at a respectful 49.1Gb. That's a pretty big download and so will take a while.

In order to speed things up, I created a torrent with the files needed to get you up to date. You can find the torrent, and instructions on how to install it below.

\*\*\*\*\*

**Torrent**: [Download here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/pk7xk80l8abm8uq/Dogecoin%20Blockchain%20Core%20-%2023%20February%202021.torrent?dl=0)  
**Updated**: 23 February 2021  
**Size**: 49.1Gb (37.7Gb Zipped)

\*\*\*\*\*

Make sure that you are running the latest version of Dogecoin Core. You can download the latest version from the [Dogecoin website](https://dogecoin.com). After you've installed it, we need to locate your Dogecoin Core data folder. The data folder location varies from system to system, but one easy way to find out is to go to ""*Help*"" > ""*Debug Console*"" and then go to the ""*Information*"" tab. The location of your Dogecoin Core data folder will be listed next to ""*datadir*"".

If you can't locate it using the method above, the default locations for the three most popular systems are as follows:

On a Linux system, it will be located at: \~/.dogecoin/  
On a Mac system, it will be located at: \~/Library/Application Support/Dogecoin  
On a Windows system, it will be located at: \\AppData\\Roaming\\Dogecoin

First things first. Make sure that you have shut down the Dogecoin Core application before you complete the following steps.

It's important that you backup and store a **copy** of the ""*wallet.dat*"" file, located within the data folder, in a safe and secure location. **If you lose this file, you will lose access to your coins**.

Once you've made a copy of the ""*wallet.dat*"" file, it's time to delete the current ""*block*"" and ""*chainstate*"" folders as well as the following, if they exist:

**Folders**  
blocks  
chainstate  
database

**Files**  
.lock  
banlist.dat  
fee\_estimates.dat  
mempool.dat  
peers.dat

**Do not touch any of the other folders and files.**

Move the downloaded ""*block*"" and ""*chainstate*"" files that you downloaded from the torrent into the Dogecoin Core data folder. If you've followed these instructions correctly, you should be able to run the Dogecoin Core application and it will sync in no time at all.

0.004,0.864,0.132,0.9983,"# Hello fellow shibes,

Today I will be explaining what the benefits are of running a full node and how you can run your own full dogecoin node, best part is that this is virtually for free for 2 months.

**What is the benefit of running a node?**

* This is a great opportunity to help maintain the doge network with little/no cost to yourself.
* Gain experience running nodes (this guide still applies for bitcoin/litecoin/othercoins)
* Being a good shibe and boosting rocket for moon
* Increased programmer capabilities (create a doge service for withdrawal/deposits without third-party, blockchain inspection etc)

**Ok, let's get into it.** *(Beginner guide, scroll for expert quick guide and using other providers)*

The first thing you will need to do is sign up at DigitalOcean for your free $100 credit, if you wish to continue running the dogecoin node after 2 months you will be paying $25p/m.

Once signed up, you will need to create a ubuntu 'droplet', **select droplets** on the left hand side and **select** **ubuntu,** select the **Basic plan** and the **$10** option.

https://preview.redd.it/s58emd08ktx51.png?width=1240&format=png&auto=webp&s=03fb72f61aea37eaed7881d9dc327844b8d147d8

Now we need to add the **block storage**, this is where our dogecoin node and blockchain data will live.

On the same page, **scroll down** and **select Block Storage**, enter the custom amount of **150GB.**

https://preview.redd.it/8nzhl209ktx51.png?width=1198&format=png&auto=webp&s=eabbfc7a32e50c0c928439694ffafad047c40ceb

Once that has been selected you can now **scroll down** to **set a droplet password**. Enter a strong root password and press **Create**!

Congratulations. You have just deployed your own ubuntu server which we will be using to run our dogecoin node. Let's **copy** down the **IP address** as we will need this later. Click on droplets on the left again to see your server IP address, It will be the only one in the list.

https://preview.redd.it/ug0rj4y9ktx51.png?width=1628&format=png&auto=webp&s=71fb7125c7afbad62a597185acd97e3caa0bf9eb

Let's login to your server! There is a few different ways you can do this depending on the operating system you are using.

* **Windows** \- You will need to download/install a tool called PuTTY, open the application and enter the ip address then click open. When asked for a user **type 'root'**, you will then be asked for a **password**, this will be the **same password** you used during **droplet creation**.
* **MacOS** \- In finder **type** 'Terminal' and **press enter**, type **ssh root@YOUR\_IP\_ADDRESS** and press enter, now enter the **same password** you used during **droplet creation**.
* **Linux** \- In Terminal, type **ssh root@YOUR\_IP\_ADDRESS** and press enter, now enter the **same password** you used during **droplet creation**.

# You are logged in now right? Awesome stuff!

Firstly you want to make sure your server is up to date.

**type** *apt-get update* and **press enter**

once this process has finished you will need to type *apt-get upgrade -y* and **press enter**.

Ok, lets install dogecoin core so we can run our node.

Firstly we need to change directories to our volume storage.**Type** *cd /mnt/* now **before** pressing enter you must **press** the **TAB key** on your keyboard, this will autofill your directory volume name, now **press enter** to navigate to the directory.

Let's download dogecoin-core! To do so you must **copy/paste** the following **command** into your **terminal** and **press enter.**

*wget* [*https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin/releases/download/v1.14.2/dogecoin-1.14.2-x86\_64-linux-gnu.tar.gz*](https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin/releases/download/v1.14.2/dogecoin-1.14.2-x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.gz)

We are nearly there now.. run these commands in your **terminal** one after the other (copy/paste, enter).

*tar -xzf* *dogecoin-1.14.2-x86\_64-linux-gnu.tar.gz*

*cd* *dogecoin-1.14.2*

*mkdir data*

*cd bin*

Ok great, we are ready to rock and roll! All we need to do now is run the following command, **do not forget** to **replace** 'ANY\_USERNAME\_HERE' with your chosen username and to **replace** 'ANY\_PASSWORD\_HERE' with your chosen password.

*./dogecoind -rpcuser=ANY\_USERNAME\_HERE -rpcpassword=ANY\_PASSWORD\_HERE -server=1 -daemon -datadir=../data*

(alternatively, you can specify a configuration file 'dogecoin.conf' with the command parameters)

Provided everything went successfully you will now be automatically downloading the 120GB(ish) dogecoin **blockchain**, once this is complete your node will be **ready for connections!**

Thank you for helping support the dogecoin community!

# Quick Guide for Expert users using digital ocean or another service.

0.015,0.825,0.16,0.9756,"Only ideas to bounce around. Only one is actually mine.   


1) transaction code, like xlm, or xrp. Doge seems to be poised to be a kind of internet money, or at least it's growing in that direction so a code to identify the order, payee or whatnot might be handy. Could potentially make ready made web merchant stuff super simple.   


2)  Something to enhance cross chain functionality. I've heard you lovely devs bouncing those ideas around, and I also tend to believe cross-chain has a lot of future. It also helps keep the main net 'pure'? I have no idea what that looks like but a random thought. If that could be enhanced in some way I could see it being a plus.   


3) Someone else mentioned this before. Transaction fees. There's good odds doge will be more fiat valuable at some point, looking at the old chartey mcchart charts. If the transaction fee could be lessened, even just a trivial smidge, like say .5 doge, or .75 doge as a default, it may help down the track."
0.048,0.854,0.098,0.9705,"So... yes that was a sudden announcement; as you may have guessed we had expected to have a little more time to prepare the release before it went out. Anyway, lets address a few questions which have arisen:

First question everyone asks, is when. Short answer is I don't know; the plan is a couple (that's approximate, no you can't hold me to exactly 14 days) of weeks after we have a stable beta. As we set these things by block number, the date will still be slightly approximate.

This leads to the obvious next question; when is the stable beta? Well, with regards to the reference client, the code in [Github](https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin) is looking fairly good at the moment (in fact, if you're running testnet infrastructure, please consider upgrading now), I'm about to start relay tests on the [testnet](http://testdoge.lionservers.de/howto/) to verify stability under load, mining stress tests have already been done for conventional mining, live network tests should start in the next few days presuming no major issues in testnet. The Android and [Multidoge](http://multidoge.org/) clients will need to be updated as part of this fork, however, and that's still a work in progress.

More critically, we only have two pieces of open source pool software that we know will build AuxPoW blocks; [p2pool](http://p2pool.info/) and [Powerpool](https://github.com/simplecrypto/powerpool/tree/master/powerpool). We really want to get [NOMP](https://github.com/zone117x/node-open-mining-portal/) to support AuxPoW as part of the update, and so far that's still in early stages; if anyone can help there please do drop by the #dogecoin-dev channel on Freenode and ask what the current state is.

What does this mean for miners? Well, you can continue to mine directly on the Dogecoin blockchain, or you can move to a Litecoin pool that supports merge-mining. Given that pools have to do a software upgrade to switch, I'm expecting there to be a stepped transition from Doge-only pools to merged pools.

Strictly, AuxPoW will accept any blocks with the required difficulty (and apologies, I have previously stated it was tied to Litecoin, and it's not), so in theory you can also mine any other Scrypt coin and submit their blocks to the Dogecoin chain as well if you find blocks at a sufficiently high difficulty. Some pools may want to explore that option just in case their miners find high-difficulty blocks by chance, but the odds of doing so aren't good.

Lastly, what does this do for 51% resistance? Well, that depends on a few things, such as how quickly AuxPoW is taken up. As I've said above, it looks likely we'll see a ramp-up of AuxPoW over time, rather than a ""big bang"" switch over. As AuxPoW kicks in it will increase the difficulty (although never to the same level as Litecoin due to blocktime differences), and as difficulty increases the hashrate to 51% the coin increases. We're bringing this in now specifically because it gives us time to ramp-up. There's further improvements to the client being evaluated  to better leverage AuxPoW as a security tool, however for now we're focusing on getting the fork in and stable."
0.011,0.84,0.149,0.9351,"Dear developers, thank you so very much for all your hard work.

Security and the perception of security are tantamount in the crypto currency world. It is even more important for the new folks joining our community.

I would like to request that the OS X and Windows apps that are released on Dogecoin.com to be signed using official Apple Developer and Windows Developer keys.

This will aid in having the applications load without having to modify settings that will make our application slightly less secure.

This stems from the [BIP66 changes introduced to mitigate malleability attacks, by enforcing strict DER signature encoding](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0066.mediawiki). This presents a problem for Dogecoin, in that obviously we want to avoid such forks forming ourselves.

[Litecoin 0.10.2 is out](https://litecointalk.org/index.php?topic=26151.0), and they'll be the next coin to go through this fork. I'm expecting that with a shorter block time and I believe better lines of communication with miners, they'll have less disruption, but I'll be monitoring closely.

Dogecoin will get these changes in Dogecoin Core 1.10 (equivalent to the upcoming Bitcoin Core 0.11). Unfortunately skipping them isn't really an option, as they're an important security improvement. We therefore have two main options:

1. Delaying and/or modifying the criteria for when the fork activates.
2. Improving communications.

At the moment I'm leaning towards a 50,000 block countdown (about 30 days) that _starts_ when 95% of new blocks are the BIP66 version, so we have that long with a clear deadline to hit (the 95% figure is a bit of a moving target, and reacts to adoption). I also want to let people know this is coming up - that's what this post is all about!

I've thought about how the rich run the system and they do it by making sure to buy goods & services from their inner circle. They help each other first and that way the money stays with them and we fight for doge scraps. Wow much sad such unfair

We should be helping shibes by looking to buy goods & services we need from them using doge or at least 20-30% doge at the start. That way shibes can earn doge and then spend the doge buying something from other shibes. This way nobody paperhands and everything is wow. 

I mean if you're going to buy something anyway why not buy it from a shibe instead of buying it from corpo XYZ that makes workers pee in coffee mugs.

Most shibes would probably be small business owners that got hit heavily by the pandemic so in the spirit of doge we're giving them a helping paw.

So why aren't we doing this? 

Well doge is still relatively niche and it's difficult to find other shibes. I know there's online marketplaces for doge & other crypto, but most of it is just digital content. We need to be able to buy doge food with doge to be taken seriously.

Introducing the actual idea:

We make a website where shibes that sell goods & services can advertise and have like a mini profile and a link to their store or a contact form or something. Other shibes can then search by products and location to find nearby shibes and buy what they need from there. 

So basically it's like an advertisement board for doge hodlers. I don't think we need to bother with facilitating the transactions ourselves. It's going to be free and run on donations. We can name it dogeboard.moon or something.

Let me know if you'd be interested in helping out with this. I'm too dumb to know how to code all of it. This is going to be charity work and I'll fund the initial running and setup costs myself."

First, is it accurate to say that while there seem to be five core active dogecoin developers, anyone can come in and propose a change, thus expanding the team naturally if there are worthy skills and commits coming in from someone?

Second, not everyone can have a final say to push out a release, correct? That is a control one for more of the current developers have?

Lastly, while the core developers turned down funding from Elon, is there anything really preventing him from hiring some serious developers that participate in the open source code base making suggestions...keeping the open source nature alive?"

0.015,0.846,0.138,0.9927,"I'll do a more general update at the end, but wanted to do another project announcement.

About a month ago I [announced a project looking at cross-chain transactions](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoindev/comments/2r86a5/experiments_in_atomic_crosschain_trades/), [CATE](https://github.com/rnicoll/cate). It's progressing well, and waiting on being able to actually find time for main network tests.

CATE is written in Python, primarily because it's a relatively well known scripting language that I felt others would be able to work in comfortably, and partly because I wanted an excuse to learn Python. To handle the interactions with the Bitcoin Core and Dogecoin Core clients, I used [Peter Todd's python-bitcoinlib](https://github.com/petertodd/python-bitcoinlib), however that library by design only handles Bitcoin (although there's a hint in the name, contrast with [bitcoin-ruby](https://github.com/lian/bitcoin-ruby/) which supports a range of altcoins). So, [python-altcoinlib](https://github.com/rnicoll/python-altcoinlib/) was born, to handle extending python-bitcoinlib to support alternative currencies.

The library is still extremely limited, however I wanted to let people know it's out there, and gather suggestions/requirements. python-altcoinlib is meant to be a first stop for anyone wanting to integrate systems with Dogecoin Core, and as such I'm looking at having it supporting common functionality (monitoring addresses, sending payments) with a relatively minimal understanding of the underlying technology required. Recipe code for this sort of activity is definitely on the to-do list, with a general intention of giving new developers an easier ""jumping off"" point. Right now, I'd really love feedback on the sort of things people want to do in code and I'll then try writing up recipes, and from there see what I can do to make it simpler.

On the reference client for a moment, merging of Bitcoin Core 0.10 patches continues full steam ahead. /u/sporklin and /u/ieuang have started handling raising of pull requests for /u/langer_hans and myself to review, and that's both streamlining the process and providing motivation. I think we're around 10-15% done now (Bitcoin Core 0.10 is HUGE) in terms of merges, and generally gaining speed as we get the processes nailed down. Some pull requests require further discussion, especially https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin/pull/833, and feedback in Github would be appreciated there.

0.01,0.933,0.057,0.9572,"Today marks the first beta release of a project I have been working on for the past three weeks, 1ClickMiner. 1ClickMiner is a Dogecoin miner that automatically finds the closest node to mine on, and begins mining in a single click of a button. 

Originally, I had planned to release an already built Windows and Linux version for everyone to beta test today, however complications arose in the computers I had access to. Instead I am releasing the source for the project, along with the directions needed to build it on Windows and Linux.

It should be known as this is primarily a Linux beta release, as I believe there are still some bugs on Windows, however you are still welcome to try building it on any system as you please. This is also a **beta** release, and it is expected for bugs to exist in the code, any coders are free to help try to fix anything that may arise.

##Build Instructions

9. The code may be downloaded from: http://github.com/argutus1/1clickminer

1. Install Python 2.7

2. Install Pyinstaller, pyserial, OpenCL, PyOpenCL and Numpy

3. Open terminal and navigate to the oneclickminer folder

4. a. If you are on windows, type 'pyinstaller OneClickGUI-windows.spec'. b. If you are on linux or mac, type 'pyinstaller OneClickGUI-linux.spec'

5. Now open up /oneclickminer/dist to find the executable file you just built

6. The executable file may be moved wherever you want as long as 'miningsetup.txt', 'nodes.txt' and 'options.txt' stay in the same directory

7. Now run Dogecoin-Core and start 1ClickMiner

8. Mining operations can then be started by clicking the button

##Info

* The executable may take a few seconds to open the first time it is run, but it should be much faster after that

* If the executable doesn't open, make sure the files listed above are in the same directory as the executable, if so, give the program more time to open

* To get the best mining speeds, find a Dogecoin node finder website, and then paste the fastest nodes in ""nodes.txt""

* The only text file you can edit is ""options.txt"", which options from ""miner-options-help.txt"" can be used, but it is not mandatory to use any options

Thanks to everyone that beta-tests this software, I am looking forward to hearing about the results. Thanks!

In my day to day work seeking accreditation and vetting companies to check they have such accreditation before using them as a supplier is what I do. So although there's nothing stopping a company operating without it, customers know a company with it will not scam them and have to adhere to a code of practice.

My suggestion is a stamp or certificate of accreditation issued by the Dogecoin Foundation. Although the details need to be worked out, they can require some basic checks. Processes, proof of identity and a code of practice to agree to. Once a company associated with dogecoin meets this expectation they are added to a list and granted accreditation. Customers these companies will then be safe in the knowledge scams such as the Moolah.io scam cannot happen with this company.

I feel this won't restrict current companies but what it would do is force a company the size of Moolah into a sizeable amount of pressure to disclose documents (which would have revealed the fraud) or be publicly displayed as not being accredited by the foundation and for users to beware, effectively cutting customers and risk.

Aaaanywho, if this gets some decent support I can draft up something far more detailed, as I said it's just vetting, the foundation will not have rights to ""audit"" whenever it feels like it

* [Update payment protocol to match Dogecoin](https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin/pull/1433)
* [RPC tests](https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin/pull/1431)

* [Enforce minor Dogecoin parameters](https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin/pull/1427)

The main two sticking points here are the RPC tests, which /u/langer_hans is working on, and fixing the default fees to match 1.10, which is still a work in progress. Once these are all in, pending finding any show stoppers, we should tag the result at 1.14 alpha 1. There's a bunch of clean up (Travis doesn't work, docs are out of date), but the core is all in place and it's enough to be a viable build at least.

It's not part of the alpha critical path, but if someone could test https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin/pull/1432 from top to bottom, print & recover wallets, ensure it works both on and offline, it would be greatly appreciated.

Once the alpha is out the remaining path to 1.14 will depend primarily how testing goes. I'm currently on leave for a week which is why we're getting so much done, but my hours will go back down from next week, so trying to get as much of this done this week, even if the review of code is then spread over the next month or so.

Lastly; 1.15 work has started, and while I was hoping to ship it in parallel to 1.14, in reality it looks like we'll have it slightly behind 1.14. I do want to test both in parallel so we know they're compatible, though!

You're welcome to link people to this post, or to copy-paste sections from here when communicating with people, or to adapt the content below for your own purposes.

**Q: Does DOGE have a fixed supply? Does DOGE have a ‚Äúcap‚Äù? Does DOGE have a ‚Äúhard cap‚Äù?**  
A: 
Yes, DOGE has a fixed supply of 10,000 coins per block. 
Yes, there is a ‚Äúcap‚Äù on how many DOGE will exist at any given time. 
No, DOGE does not have a ‚Äúhard cap‚Äù because there will never be a day when no more DOGE is issued.

Bitcoin does have a hard cap, which means its supply increase (""inflation"") will go to 0% after 2140. DOGE‚Äôs supply increase is 3.94% in 2021 and it falls every year and over a very long period of time will eventually get arbitrarily low (e.g. 0.00000000000000000001%) but will never reach exactly 0%.

Three of the best well-known cryptocurrencies have selected different solutions  
- Bitcoin has a fixed supply, and a hard cap.  
- Dogecoin has a fixed supply, but no hard cap.  
- Ethereum has an unfixed supply, and no hard cap.  

Nobody knows which solution is best, but we think it is smart to keep minting some coins each year, because some coins are always lost from circulation, and we want to encourage people to spend coins and not hoard them.

**Q: Does this mean ‚Äúunlimited‚Äù or ‚Äúinfinite‚Äù DOGE can exist at any time?**  
A: No. Here we hand over to Dogecoin Developer /u/patricklodder, who writes

> The fallacy in the ""unlimited coin theory"" is this:
> 
> - Time is unlimited
> - Dogecoin issues a predefined amount of new coin over time
> - Therefore, there are unlimited coins.
> 
> This is correct. But now:
> 
> - At any point in time, the value of dogecoin will drop, because there are unlimited coins.
> 
> This is false, because at any point in time, there is still a limit to the amount of DOGE. Only if you look over infinite time, is there infinite DOGE.

Imagine you make $30 per hour at a 9am-5pm job. If someone asks you how much money you make, would you say ‚ÄúI actually make infinite dollars, because if you assume I live forever I would never stop making money‚Äù? No, you would say ‚ÄúI make $30 an hour‚Äù or ‚ÄúI make $62,000 per year‚Äù. 

Similarly, if someone asks about DOGE 'inflation', you should say ‚ÄúDoge supply increase is currently 3.94% per year, and it gets lower every year‚Äù. 

**Q: I heard that 10,000 DOGE are minted every minute. Isn‚Äôt that a lot of DOGE?**  
A: At first it sounds like a big number, given Bitcoin only mints 96,162 Bitcoins per year. But did you know Bitcoin minted 96,162,000,000,000 Satoshis in 2020? Changing the base unit can make a dramatic shift in how large the supply increase seems to be. However, it only makes sense to consider the percentage supply increase per year. The raw units do not allow any basis for comparison between coins, because every crypto denominates their coins differently.

**Q: OK, if we should consider percentage supply increase, what is DOGE‚Äôs percentage supply increase?**  
A: Here is the total number of Dogecoins available at the end of each year of its existence, and the percentage change year on year. 

[End 2013](https://coinmarketcap.com/historical/20131231/): 18,211,323,904 Dogecoins in circulation  
[End 2014](https://coinmarketcap.com/historical/20141231/): 97,204,400,153 (+434.8% increase in supply)  
[End 2015](https://coinmarketcap.com/historical/20151231/): 102,460,278,024 (+5.41% increase in supply)  
[End 2016](https://coinmarketcap.com/historical/20161231/): 107,529,653,033 (+4.95% increase in supply)  
[End 2017](https://coinmarketcap.com/historical/20171231/): 112,578,744,538 (+4.70% increase in supply)  
[End 2018](https://coinmarketcap.com/historical/20181231/): 117,640,040,831 (+4.50% increase in supply)  
[End 2019](https://coinmarketcap.com/historical/20191231/): 122,701,414,426 (+4.30% increase in supply)  
[End 2020](https://coinmarketcap.com/historical/20201231/): 127,748,316,518 (+4.11% increase in supply)  

There is estimated to be 3.94% supply increase in 2021. 2022 will be even lower, and 2023 lower still, and so on forever. 

**Q: Will supply increase cause the DOGE price in USD to fall?**  
A: Even in the early years when DOGE‚Äôs supply increase was higher its price in USD managed to rise over time. If DOGE managed to rise in 2018 with a supply increase of 4.50% there is no reason why it can‚Äôt rise in 2021 with  a supply increase of 3.94%, especially because there is now a lot more interest in DOGE. 

**Q: How does DOGE‚Äôs supply increase compare to Bitcoin‚Äôs?**  
A: It is quite similar for the early years.  

2020 was the 8th year of Dogecoin‚Äôs life, and DOGE had 4.11% supply increase during 2020.  
2016 was the 8th year of Bitcoin‚Äôs life, and Bitcoin had 6.95% supply increase during 2016.  

You can easily verify this yourself through simple calculations made on the coinmarketcap pages for 2015 and 2016 listed above.

The main difference with Bitcoin is that DOGE‚Äôs supply increase never gets to exactly 0%, and it declines at a more steady pace. Again, we think this is smart because we want to encourage people to spend coins instead of hoarding them.

**Q: Is a big DOGE whale who can crash the price?**  
A: No - the DOGE ‚Äúwhale‚Äù isn‚Äôt actually a whale but rather an exchange. It belongs to Robinhood (source: https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-17/cryptocurrency-sleuths-point-to-robinhood-as-dogecoin-whale). 

Although we would prefer that people were out there spending their DOGE instead of holding it on an exchange, it is not a bad thing that a very large number of people on Robinhood each have a small amount of coin. We want DOGE to be spread out as much as possible, so that everyone has a stake in our currency.

**Q: Is DOGE going to die?**  
A: Short answer: What is DOGE may never die.

Long answer: DOGE has been around since 2013 and has thrived when thousands of other cryptocurrencies have faded. Here‚Äôs the first day Dogecoin was listed on CoinMarketCap: https://coinmarketcap.com/historical/20131215. Do you see many other names you recognize?

**Q: What is going to happen to the DOGE price in USD?**  
A: We haven‚Äôt got a clue, and neither does anyone else. All we know is that √ê1 is going to stay √ê1."

Personally I think that should be just about the first thing people see as soon as they navigate to the website. I believe that is the intention of the majority of browsers. Most have heard about it, but then get to the website and there is no way to actually acquire it. Vetted reputable exchanges could be listed and they could even be referral links that provide some benefit to a fund for dogecoin development, or not.

I think the vast majority of people still are not getting into dogecoin because it is just too difficult, or worse, buying it on Robinhood. There are far too many Robinhood users and I'd like to see more exchanges acquiring doge customers.

So, is this something worth using my web design skills to do a design pull request, or has this already been discussed and decided against?

0.011,0.824,0.165,0.9951,"It was hard for people to accept merged mining of doge with litecoin initially because it felt like we were loosing control of our coin.  I wasn't around back then but it seems like this was a common sentiment and makes sense to me.

What if there was a different possibility for merged mining, one that gives a coin still a sense of uniqueness and independence while also allowing for merged mining?

My proposition is something I will term asymmetric or asymmetrical merged mining.  Basically a coin can be merge mined, but only at say 2/3 the normal hashrate.  What this would mean is that if you were already mining litecoin then for sure you would want an additional 2/3 of hashpower going to another coin reward for free.  But if you were a true believer in doge, you would mine doge at full strength and then merge mine litecoin at 2/3 power.

So anyway if this is technically possible to code at this point, I think it would be a perfect solution to the murky question of whether merged mining is always the best choice for a coin to make.

A downside of course would be that you are giving up useful hashpower to secure the network, basically for nothing in return in 100/66 merged mining rather than 100/100.  But my response to that is currently the only option is 100/100 or 100/0.  This option would give more granularity for a decision rather than a binary decision.  Also it would incentivize devs in both coins to open up merged mining for eachother, instead of a one sided thing like with litecoin and doge where you can only mine primarily on litecoin and also merge mine on doge but not the other way around.  The asymmetric nature would make both dev teams want to open up merged mining for eachother on their own blockchains allowing much more independence for each coin.

Thoughts?"

If we are trying to move to a more decentralized form of currency then that could be an incentive to buy a Tesla. It could be built like receiving a staking reward for how many miles you drive.

Forgive if this has been posted previously and I didn't find it ...

With Dogecoin having a need for more Full Nodes, and Full Nodes being something that can be set up on VMs, I was wondering if it might be worth trying to fund the creation of as many as we can crowdfund.

I haven't done any research to see how much it might cost to host a full node VM, and I would be very interested in knowing if there's some way to get a rough count of how many would help us today, and as we grow - i.e., so we could figure out how to get going cost-wise, and plan for the future.

As it seems a difficult ask to get noobs to install Dogecoin Core and set up a Full Node, and we seem to really be in need of more Full Nodes, I thought this might be one way?

In summary, I think it might be awesome to figure out:

* what's a minimum number of full nodes that would benefit us now
* how much does hosting one full node on a vm cost
* plan for scale

0.04,0.848,0.112,0.9373,"Edit:  probably misleading title, as the pledges don't happen in the blockchain, they happen as transaction inputs which don't appear on the blockchain until the transaction is sent when the output is reached.

Edit 2:  Apparently this is exactly what bitcoin's lighthouse wallet project does https://www.vinumeris.com/lighthouse (github: https://github.com/vinumeris/lighthouse)

In this video https://youtu.be/YG7l0XPtzD4?t=16m23s, the presenter tells of how a transaction can be created with a given output which will only go through once enough inputs exist to match the output.  In this way, many people can make a pledge to send X amount of coins, (by signing their own inputs to the transaction) if the crowdfunding goal is reached, however they are not sending and therefore not risking any coins until the output goal is met.  And presumably, they could cancel that input at any time beforehand?  

I think this could be very useful for dogecoin fundraising efforts, as I get the impression often times that shibes don't want to give money because they don't think a particular effort will succeed, so they don't want to waste money on it.  In this way, the coins are only sent when the goal is met so people don't have to risk giving to an unsuccessful campaign.  And the number of coins pledged can be tracked (I think?)

0.025,0.926,0.049,0.5487,"A new version of Dogecoin Core, v1.14.4, has been released and can be downloaded from the Github [release page](https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin/releases/tag/v1.14.4). This is a minor update that includes important performance improvements and prepares the network for lower recommended fees, per the [fee policy change proposal](https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin/discussions/2347). It is a recommended update for all shibes.

This release can be installed over an existing 1.14 installation seamlessly, without the need for uninstallation, re-indexation or re-download. Simply shut down your running Dogecoin-QT or dogecoind, perform the installation and restart your node.

Most important changes are:

**Enabling Future Fee Reductions**

Prepares the network for a reduction of the recommended fees by reducing the default fee requirement 1000x for transaction relay and 100x for mining. At the same time it increases freedom for miner, wallet and node operators to agree on fees regardless of defaults coded into the Dogecoin Core software by solidifying fine-grained controls for operators to deviate from built-in defaults.

This realizes **the first part of a two-stage update** to lower the fee recommendation - a followup release will implement the lower fee recommendation, once the network has adapted to the relay defaults introduced with this version of Dogecoin Core.

**Synchronization Improvements**

Removes a bug in the network layer where a 1.14 node would open many parallel requests for headers to its peers, increasing the total data transferred during initial block download up to 50 times the required data, per peer, unnecessarily. As a result, synchronization time has been reduced by around 2.5 times.

Right now there is a little unease, particularly within the sphere of major investors. Love them or hate them, major investors keep the price buoyant which makes mining all the more worth while.

Lack of confidence is rising, not just as a consequence of any potential hashrate problem, but perhaps more because there doesn't seem to be a single voice of authority prepared to tackle the situation. 

JP has said let the community decide, yet the community don't seem to know what is best.

My personal feeling is that we should merge-mine with Litecoin. I really don't understand any of the emotional sentiment that some critics of this plan have put forward; things like ""the way that Litecoin asked us was wrong."" etc.

We have an enormously powerful network effect, and we can easily combat this issue and strengthen any perceived weaknesses.

0.097,0.788,0.115,0.9002,"I have a suggestion for DogeCoin to solve 90% of the current problems with mining, value, and security. 

Since I was unable to get a massive number of people behind me to bring this to the front page on /r/dogecoin I though I'd submit it to a wise group of shibes.

*Please read it in full (The Problems Section is an optional read, but it backs up my reasons)*

####The Problems:
1. ASIC mining is centralizing mining power
 - ASIC Mining causes centralization which can lead to 51% attacks
 - Centralized mining mines for immediate profit, which causes the mining parties to sell immediately for a better trading currency, in this case BitCoin. Since they need to sell, the price does not matter, they will sell regardless.
 - The lack of a broad miner base will decrease the market development of DogeCoin since the mining groups will not want a market increase in DogeCoin if it steals any market from BitCoin
2. Multipools still change the hashrate to some extent (not at the moment since DogeCoin is not the top coin)
3. Securing the Coin against 51% attack in the long term


####My Solution:
1. Switch to X11 (or another Multi-algorithm) Proof of Work mining.
 - X11 is Resistant to ASICs and will allow even poor shibes to mine on laptops, not profitably, but still decently. 
 - X11 is more power efficient than Scrypt since it uses less power to mine
 - X11 is Resistant to Multipools since the mining algorithm is unique to the coins that run that particular type of X11, for example, for all the coins using X11 (Multi Algorithm, not just the X11 function), only 3 popular ones use DarkCoin's  particular X11. 
2. Switch to Multi-POW using X11 + Scrypt (Merged With LiteCoin) + SHA-256 (Merged with BitCoin) around Block 500,000 or Block 600,000
 - This Secures the blockchain for the long term since we'd be using BitCoin's hashing power.
 - ""But BitCoin would have to agree!"" Actually they would not, all we have to do is have a decent value and mining pools will add us to their merged mining since it would be additional profit.
 - It's extremely hard to perform a 51% attack when there are many different chip manufacturers making SHA-256 ASICs.
 - 51% attacks would be nearly impossible if the coin was split amongst 3 groups as suggested. One would have to gain 51% of SHA-256 ASICs and Scrypt ASICs and X11 GPU's
 - All 5% of the additional coins each year could be mined and the inflation would become a true 5% if all were sold immediately. (If some were held back by any mining party for future sales, the inflation would drop below 5% by a fraction proportional to the coins held back). 

Please let me know what you think. I ask before you downvote this, please allow some visibility so others can get their observations and evaluations of this idea. I understand that this contains 2 forks, but due to the short time of DogeCoin production, it's the only current solution that can logically work without relying on future possibilities that may or may not happen.

This post is a bit to talk about the development process, a bit to update everyone, and a bit to track status for the other developers.

One of the issues we had with early Dogecoin releases was how to efficiently test compatibility of new releases with software such as mining pools. The RPC ( https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/API_reference_(JSON-RPC) ) interface is extensive and the commands interact with each other, making it time consuming to test effectively. Bitcoin Core solved this by introducing a set of tests which emulate services using the RPC interface.

These are important because Bitcoin isn't designed to support restructuring it, as we do (although more recent releases are vastly easier to update), so some of the changes we make can interact in unexpected ways with the base code. Issues such as the memory usage of 1.10 were indicated by the RPC tests, although at the time we missed the connection between the test problems and memory.

Max has updated the majority of the tests, reducing numbers of blocks mined to match Dogecoin maturity numbers, increasing transaction amounts to compensate for differences in fee schemes, etc. However, we have a small number of tests which fail due to unclear reasons, plus others which fail intermittently. My current concern is https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin/blob/1.14-dev/qa/rpc-tests/p2p-fullblocktest.py , which fails when testing that coinbase (mining reward) payments cannot be spent too early. I've checked and re-checked the numbers and the logs and it looks correct, and have had to take a break for now.

If you want to dig into these, the tests are run by:

1. Build 1.14-dev (note it creates `bitcoind` because it's not rebranded yet)
2. Run `qa/pull-tester/rpc-tests.py p2p-fullblocktest` to run just the full block tests, or `qa/pull-tester/rpc-tests.py` to run the full standard test suite (this will highlight other failing tests to tackle later).
3. Wait for ages for the first run (it's a bit faster on later runs), like seriously think about getting some food while this works.
4. It will fail and report the error.

When the test fails, it will leave behind the generated node configurations, logs and wallets (the path is displayed at the start of the tests running). You can also get more detail by running the tests with the option `--tracerpc`.

The other major failing test I'm struggling with is `fundrawtransaction`, which seems to be highlighting some sort of issue with watch only addresses. On line 617 ( https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin/blob/1.14-dev/qa/rpc-tests/fundrawtransaction.py#L617 ) it fails while trying to spend funds that node 3 should have access to because node 0 sent them to an address node 3 is watching, however for whatever reason node 3 seems unaware of those funds. Checking the generated wallet seems to suggest the address is watched correctly, but it doesn't realise the transaction is relevant.

We're working on these, but if anyone wants to dig in, please do go for it :)

Perhaps it can help if we reframe things a little and have a simplified and clear explanation that doesn't provoke counter-questions. I provide an explanation which is a little simplified and geared toward newcomers.

For people who say Dogecoin is ""unlimited"" or ""permanently inflationary""
Answer:

1.	‚Å†Dogecoin supply inflation is currently 3.9% per year, and it falls every year.
2.	‚Å†Over time new supply eventually would fall to an arbitrarily low value (0.0000000000001% per year, etc) but can never reach exactly 0%.
3.	‚Å†There are always coins lost due to abandoned dust and lost keys. At some point (and maybe already) these lost coins will outweigh the new supply. Therefore Dogecoin is a deflationary coin.

Elon Musk expressed this point succinctly when he wrote: ""Doge appears to be inflationary, but is not meaningfully so (fixed # of coins per unit time), whereas BTC is arguably deflationary to a fault.""

For people who say Dogecoin has ""No Cap""
Answer: Dogecoin has a cap, and that cap is 10k per block. It is not like fiat which lacks a cap because the supply can be adjusted at any point. Doge's new supply is fixed eternally at 10k per block. This amounts to 3.9% supply inflation in 2021, and every year it gets lower, but it never gets to literally 0%.

Elon Musk expressed this point succinctly when he wrote: ""Doge appears to be inflationary, but is not meaningfully so (fixed # of coins per unit time), whereas BTC is arguably deflationary to a fault.""

I'm happy for any shibe to copy-paste these answers, and I think they resolve 99% of queries about supply."

But then there was this unofficial poll on Twitter about what could be the community's choice to name the fraction of Doge.

Then, as many of you commented in the last post, Billy explained how his first choice is the already known ""koinu"" which means puppy in Japanese, which also sounds like coin.

And then this happened:

I know it's not official and consensus should be made in a near future by the community, but I'm just happy it got one step closer for Wow. Because, any canine reference can be assimilated by other alternatives, but no one can use Wows as naturally as our Doge (It's the OG meme!)

Anywho, not robbing more time from you, #MuchWow to y'all.

PD: In hindsight, this post may seem egocentric or exagerated, but I acknowledge I'm no owner of this idea, just a supporter of it. Proclaiming ""I was first, it was my idea"", that's just silly. I'm just sharing my sheer joy that we are closer to full meme circle when wow gets adopted as the official fraction of a dogecoin."

0.039,0.802,0.159,0.9927,"Hi all, I got sucked into the Doge fun back in 2013/2014 during my senior year in HS. I even started mining doge and got some of my friends to buy doge and laugh at all the memes and craziness. Remember the Doge NASCAR? Good times. When I left for college my dad threw out my old desktop computer and I thought I lost my wallet for good. I found recently that he had saved everything to dropbox and I was able to find my wallet.dat and part of the dogecoin QT (can't find dogecoin-qt.exe). According to the readme I had version 1.5.0.

I've tried looking around to figure out how to access my old doge and found [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/7g740t/is_there_a_way_to_recover_a_wallet_from_an_old/) that seems to explain what to do but it's also a bit dated so I'm unsure whether there's newer or better ways to recover my doge. Also when I click on my wallet.dat file I get a EULA pop-up from CyberLink. I have no clue whether to accept or not. I haven't done anything yet out of caution, and would appreciate an explanation for what that is about. 

I unfortunately don't have any of my passwords or the key due to a glitch on my iphone deleting all the login detail I kept in the notes app. If there is a way for me to access my old doge (~50K-80K dogecoins) I would graciously appreciate any help to get it back. And a thorough step-by-step explanation would also be very appreciated as I have been out of the crypto game for a long time and don't know as much as I did back in 2014. If y'all can help me get access I'll use some of my GME winnings to double my dogecoin ownership. Thanks!

EDIT: I forgot to mention but I was able to access my coinbase account that I used to buy the bitcoin that I sent to my wallet to trade for dogecoin. So I might be able to find the address for my wallet, if that's useful in recovering my dogecoin."

I have some pretty regular household items (i.e. movies, unused electronics, a huge football card collection, a small library, a growing kid and my wife that has a whole attic full of clothes she will never wear.) I can paint, but not anything crazy. I like to do simple things, such as acrylic pour or spin. I like to make memes and photo editing. My wife likes to cross-stitch, knit, paint(she is way better), basically anything creative.

If anyone is setting up a store and doesn't mind sharing some ideas, I could use all the advice I can get at this moment. I am running in circles with research, but thats another reason why I want to help. The more people who understand what Dogecoin is, how it is obtained and maintained, and how it is spent, the better.

They seem like a nice community and I particularly appreciate that the lead developer /u/meor seems - like our Dogecoin core developers - to conduct himself in a professional and courteous manner.

Like Dogecoin, they are aiming to make a currency that is great for everyday use and offers fast transaction times, in their case with no fees at all instead of Dogecoin's tiny fees. 

A few times (e.g. [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/RaiBlocks/comments/7l5azv/if_xrb_wants_to_be_a_currency_shouldnt_there_be/), [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/RaiBlocks/comments/7ko5l7/colin_lemahieu_founder_and_lead_developer_of/driq3r6/)) it has been pointed out that given its goals raiblocks might work better if it was inflationary, since they could thereby motivate nodes to participate while also reducing the incentive to hoard.

It occurs to me that there is another currency that is already inflationary and which already has an interest in the micropayments and everyday use niche - our beloved Dogecoin.

This brings me to my question

**If it does turn out that this DAG stuff works well, is there any reason why Dogecoin could not convert to it either directly by changing algorithms or by simply airdropping ""DAG-doge"" coins to every Dogecoin holder?**

Note that I'm not here asserting that DAG will work well. I am just asking hypothetically about what can be done if it does turn out to be superior. Although due to AuxPoW Dogecoin doesn't have the carbon footprint of other pure-PoW coins, it does seem like it would be nice to get away from pure PoW if possible and into some more efficient PoS or PoS/PoW system."

I am sure you knew about Bitpay adopting Dogecoin before we did, but I believe this is one of the biggest positive news to come to Doge in the past weeks, also considering that Bitpay is extremely selective in their choice of cryptos (Bitcoin and Eth are the only non stable coins, I believe).

Do you think it would make sense to somehow pinpoint the news to our users, maybe also through the Twitter channel?

I have used BitPay in clients websites in the past, and they have plugins ready for Wordpress (through Woocommerce), Magento, and more. This means two of the biggest e-commerce platforms have already a fool proof, secure implementation to allow Dogecoin payments, backed by a large company.

Wanted to write a quick post on things that are going on and the devs would love some help with:

1. Testnet infrastructure. Thanks to everyone who's volunteered mining power, we'll get back to you ASAP. Right now, we need to get as many nodes on testnet updated as possible. If you run a node, know someone who runs a node, want to run a node, whatever, please move to the 1.8-dev branch from Github now. The more nodes we get across, the more realistic the stress tests will be.

2. AuxPoW pool software; I know there's evaluation going on for NOMP already, but if you know node.js please nudge me, I think we could do with some help there. If you know Python, please consider looking at stratum-mining and see if you can modify it to handle AuxPoW somehow; you may need to look at MPOS as well to have it understand what's going on, of course.

3. dogecoinj unit tests; if you fancy some work that's easily verified, although tricky and relatively tedious, the unit tests in dogecoinj 0.11 (https://github.com/langerhans/dogecoinj-new/tree/release-0.11) need to be updated to match Dogecoin instead of Bitcoin.

0.044,0.842,0.114,0.8879,"Hi, I have what is surely a newb question: I'm running Dogecoin Core 1.14.3 on macOS 10.15.7 and I noticed that during initial block download (IBD) I had little to no upload traffic.

Now that I'm past IBD, Dogecoin Core is generally doing an ok job saturating my upstream bandwidth: as measured with

```sh
nettop -p $(pgrep Dogecoin-Qt) -J bytes_out -d
```

the `bytes_out` of the process is typically 400-600 KiB/s (cf. Transmission which could sustain 500-700 KB/s).

I have what are probably basic questions about Dogecoin's protocol:

1. Is it true && by design that I'm not sending blocks to needy peers while I'm syncing my own chain? If so, why? Feels maybe motivated by some subtle (or not) security concern, perhaps.
2. In general, should I expect Dogecoin Core to saturate my upstream bandwidth (O(5 to 6 Mbps)) when run with default options? Assuming there's ample CPU/memory available for it to claim.

Thanks!"
0.017,0.913,0.071,0.926,"All, it seems that one of the best things we could do is to add more peers to the network so that initial synchronizations are much faster and so that there is lower latency in the system. Using a bootstrap file is somewhat antithetical to the nature of peer-to-peer blockchain verification, ex: an influx of all new users use the same blockchain provides only a single source for the block chain.

Therefore, I propose that we set up peer cores the are funded by the community using dogecoin. New peers would get added to a list along with the wallet address that funds it. I have just set up one peer and figure it would cost about $20 to keep it running per month and therefore at current rates about 200 dogecoin. So for every 200 dogecoin (at current rates) I will add an additional peer (and adjust accordingly depending on the cost per month).

This accomplishes two major things: 1) setting up a larger network that is crowd created and decreases latency in the system, and 2) creates a new marketplace for dogecoin which creates liquidity and adds value to the currency. The other good thing is that the address wallet balance can be looked up and monitored so that the community can check that funds are being allocated appropriately and that there are an adequate number of peers set up based on the amount of dogecoin that has been ever deposited int that wallet.

The next step would be to set up a running list with peer addresses and matching wallets.

What are your thoughts, I've started with the below peer and can add the matching address once we set up the list system. We can do dogecoin tips for now.

* Port all the protocol changes that make up the DOGE asset and the Dogecoin chain security. This roughly consists of:
  1. The chain and asset identifiers, blocktime, issuance/subsidy and scrypt 
  1. Digishield and other feature enablement
  1. AuxPoW
* Set up softforks for enablement of new protocol/consensus functionality
* Brand everything as Dogecoin (UI and help texts)
* Add Dogecoin specific wallet features such as the paper wallet generator

Currently the first two items of phase 1 are done, and only AuxPoW remains to close off this phase. We have draft code for this in [https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin/pull/1974](https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin/pull/1974), and we‚Äôll be breaking that huge pull request down into smaller requests which can be meaningfully reviewed.

So what next for the pink QT, or any other change compared to the reference client? Well, now when 1.7.2 comes out, I'll personally build 1.7.2-pink for those who are into that sort of thing. It will be a combination of all of the core of 1.7.2, with the minor tweaks to make it pink.

Lets say, however, that I want to sneak the pink version in, so I modify the 1.7.2 source and try to give have the pink binaries linked on the website. Well, each client version is built independently by the three core developers, the results cryptographically signed and compared. Those have to match, or we go back and work out why they don't match. No luck there either, sorry Sporklin.

This is essentially the same process we ask others to follow; request changes via Github issues, or submit them as code via pull requests. We'll review the change and act on it if appropriate. If you disagree with us, you're welcome to fork (copy) the source code and build your own version instead. Naturally we'd expect the community to carefully consider source of any alternative wallet, though.

Administrivia for the week:

Most of the developers are busy merging in the 150-ish changes from Bitcoin 0.9 to Bitcoin 0.9.2, to make the 1.7.2 client. I've been busy applying for new jobs, and sometimes poking at payment protocol.

Please send feature requests/suggestions in via Github ( https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin/issues?state=open ), as it has the structures in place to support discussion, as well as helping users search for existing requests.

There's [another major OpenSSL security issue](https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv_20140605.txt) that's been discovered. A 1.7.1 client is being prepared, however unless you use RPC over SSL (a very unusual combination) you're fine to stick to the existing clients.

For those asking about changes, we're still definitely not planning on any change to the proof of work scheme before block 600k, barring a security issue. There is also no planned change at the 600k block, I'm just using it as an estimate of where we might consider PoS adoption if we have to. p2pool adoption is still a good idea (and I'm aware I have a few username mentions about p2pool which I need to get back to).

We're currently developing a new fantasy sports platform (http://shadosports.com) and were playing with the idea of allowing teams to fund their payrolls via Dogecoin.

The short version is: We're creating the D&D of fantasy sports and are allowing teams to have budgets/payrolls funded by real money. So, if a player is signed to a $15M contract, that team owner would pay $15 or $1.5, whatever the league's setting would be.

We were interested in letting teams contribute Dogecoin as an alternative/accompaniment to normal funding. Obviously, the Dogecoin community is active and expanding, but I don't know how much interest in Fantasy sports there are. Or if, from a dev standpoint, this has been done before/can't be done.

**2021** *-Scale 2x current-*

1. Reduce min tx fees to below 1 cent in 1.14.4 update. Elon suggests 100x reduction, I suggest 200x (which would put us at half a cent when we hit $1)
2. Once fee is reduced, monitor blocksize for 3 months. See if the blocksize increases significantly and we have any spam issues. I anticipate blocksize will not change significantly and there will be no spam issues. Continue to address current node syncing issues.
3. If blocksize is stable, implement segwit and double max blocksize to 2mb at the same time in 1.21 update.

**2022** *-Scale 8x current-*

1. Address any issues with segwit and monitor that blocksize is stable.  Finish up addressing node syncing issues.
2. Once everything is stable, reduce blocktime by one-half to 30 seconds. Monitor syncing and orphan rate. Orphan rate should always stay below 10%.
3. Once everything is stable double blocksize again (to 4mb). Monitor for spam and adjust min tx fee accordingly. Implement lightning code as needed.

**2023** *-Scale 16x current-*

1. Once everything is stable reduce blocktime by one-half to 15 seconds. Monitor syncing and orphan rate.

**2024** *-Scale 40x current-*

1. Once everything is stable Increase max blocksize to 10mb (10x bitcoin and our current blocksize). Adjust min tx fee as needed to keep blockchain growth under control and in-line with our recommended full node specifications \*.

**Beyond** *-Scale potentially 100x + current-*

1. As orphan rate approaches 5% consider future incremental blocktime decreases to eventually 6-7 seconds or faster depending on how we can stay synced and maintain orphan rate below 10%.
2. If we get to the point that block space is limited and fees are increasing, consider increasing max blocksize while keeping to parameters of node syncing and orphan rate.

\***Notes:**

* Of course we will need to change block reward every time blocktime is updated to maintain a constant emission of 10,000 coins per minute.
* We need to develop metrics and measures for orphan rate and syncing rate.
* We need to develop suggested specifications for full nodes and required specifications for full nodes. RAM, processor speed/cores, and storage space should be specified. We need to consider that each full node does the job of the entire paypal server farm and therefore a rudimentary server will be required if we progress beyond a hobby project. In light of this we need to make running a ""pruning node"" easily selected from the core wallet.
* If energy usage / asic unavailability due to chip shortage becomes a serious issue and is causing potential centralization, consider change of PoW algorithm to [ProgPoW](https://github.com/ifdefelse/ProgPOW) which is a well developed ASIC resistant GPU friendly hashing algorithm. If energy use or GPU availability becomes a major concern, there is always the CPU algo [Yespower](https://github.com/openwall/yespower).
* If Proof of Work proves way too slow or other serious problems with PoW arise (in other words; ""if all else fails""), we can consider a change to PoS or Proof of Rest [\#1942](https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin/issues/1942) or some other solution. Or PoS as a layer 2 [\#1924](https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin/issues/1924).
* We should also do research into how our nodes sync with having our nonce in other chains' (we are merge mined with all scrypt coins, not just Litecoin) blockchain and how that effects our syncing, if at all.
* Consider improving/tweaking payout protocols for development contributions with the goal that someone can quit their job and work full time on dogecoin development with minimal risk.
* Consider Zk-Rollups support for layer 2 as an addition to Layer 2 lightning."

What this means is that when you find a share above the current pool difficulty (one which gets you on the payout list), that share will expire and therefore remove you from the payout list **12** hours after it was submitted.

I've just updated my **[Dogecoin P2Pool Calculator](http://www.nckpnny.com/sharecalc)** and added a PPLNS window parameter, so that you can compare the probability that you will find a share in a 24 hour window vs. a 12 hour window. The relationship between your probability of seeing a payout and PPLNS window size isn't linear for a given hash rate, so slower miners will see a much larger difference than those with fast rigs.

The shorter PPLNS window biases the system a bit toward miners with high hash rates, which I feel is a detriment to the P2Pool network if we are to be a coin that is inclusive of people who don't have the cash to shell out for mega-rigs (which I personally think we should be).

Changing the share chain length on P2Pool isn't the simplest of tasks, because it would mean that every P2Pool node would have to update to the current codebase at more-or-less the same time...but I think it might be worthwhile.

0.029,0.881,0.091,0.9893,"So I'm not actually a dogecoin dev, I just got into doge from the recent hype and have just been lurking around the github for the past couple weeks, but...

Are there any plans to update the wallets?

From a new user perspective with not really any crypto background they seem kinda clunky. Specifically:

*The long sync times when initially downloaded could be turning off new users.I downloaded the windows and android wallets a week ago and both are still not synced. If there is a technological improvement that can speed this up, i think it would improve the experience. 

Whether or not the actually sync speed can be improved or not, I think there also needs to be a little more clarity during that so that people know what is happening, and don't just think their wallet is broken or buggy. Just a text field or more visible sync status more prominently displayed explaining that is is syncing (for the android app). If there could also be tips like 'leave your pc/phone on and let this app run in the background for a few days' would be an improvement.

*The android wallet gui could use a layout update. It kinda looks old and it's just not as intuitive as it should be. The send and receive buttons are right there, so that's good, but navigating around to the other features is confusing. 

Specifically, make the send and receive buttons larger, put the balance in the middle of the screen instead of on top, show a dogecoin on the main screen next to or above the balance. It's not clear what the addresses icon is supposed to be (I think a tag of some sort) so maybe just change it to 'addresses' and 'my wallets'? Alternatively, maybe use the same icons used for 'contact list' apps on phones?

I big annoyance to me is that on the android wallet, you have to swipe left and right to navigate between your wallet and other addresses and peers and blocks on the network monitor screen. The users should also be able to click the titles 'peers' and 'blocks' at the top like tab headers. They would also need to be larger. 

My two cents. There's also plenty of reviews on google play with other specific feedback about the android wallet. On the whole, the windows wallet is pretty nice (minus the long sync time), but both the android and windows wallet could use a facelift to something more modern looking. Maybe just a color scheme change (since I don't think it would do to remove comic sans font).

Any plans for an ios app?

Great job and thank you to the devs for all your hard work! Much wow! I look forward to seeing the release of the updates you have been working on! üêïüëç

Edit: This is my experience using the wallet that is still not synced, so take these notes with a grain of salt since I haven't actually been able to use it for transactions yet. I just like hearing myself talk I guess...

Edit 2: MultiDoge vs Dogecoin Core. Maybe list 'everyday transactions' directly under MultiDoge on the download screen and 'mining/long-term storage' below the core icon on the download screen?

Edit: using dogecoin Core for windows."

It's a great way to educate the masses at a fast pace. You just send it out/refer someone to it. This allows for a much higher retention rate, especially for the newcomers that haven't even ever touched a cryptocurrency before. I would like to propose the following infographics:

1. I notice in particularly that folks from the US are having immense trouble of actually finding a way on how to buy Dogecoin. We want to of course have people own the actual coin instead of just buying shares on Robinhood. So I figured, why not have us setup an infographic for people that will show where they can actually get Dogecoins that are the best options based on where they are from. Even with emphasis on certain states, cities in the US since I hear there are some nuances in regards to this as well on a states/city level in the US.
2. Another infographic that explains the fundamentals of cryptos in simple language. So that newcomers will be able to get familiar and comfortable with cryptos, Dogecoin that is. Obviously Dogecoin has a very easy accessibility to the general public so I feel we should make use of educating those newcomers as much as possible.
3. An infograph showing what people have used Dogecoin for so far. Mentioning also significant events Dogecoin has been engaged in. It's good to let people know what Dogecoin is about. Possibly even point out any misconceptions of the coin and communicate what makes the coin good to go for.
4. Infographic that's specific for individuals and business owners. Explaining to business owners how they can integrate Dogecoin into their payment process.

These infographics would need to be simple, friendly, easy to read, direct with non-assumptive language. This is what Dogecoin can do so well and the general essence of simplicity of Dogecoin is what makes it such a strong coin. Let's make use of this as much as possible. Also those inforgraphics can be separate, or in 1 infographic. Probably as 1 infograph wouldn't be bad to have so we can always direct people to it instead of just sending a bunch of different infographs and just lay out the infographic in a proper organised fashion.

We'd need people with the in-depth knowledge. The people who are able to communicate the information in the appropriate format and folks for design. And then folks to push it out to the public in massive volume.

We all need to consider priorities. I woke up this morning to discover another attempt to reduce the number of unpaid volunteers working on Dogecoin. We're burning actual serious amounts of time running around dealing with politics, and it's crazy. A few in the community would seemingly rather we have no-one. Certainly, they're consuming crazy amounts of time rebuking their claims.

So:

1. My dev posts will go in /r/dogecoindev from here on, so they're more easily found for future reference. They'll be cross-linked to /r/dogecoin where needed.

2. If you need to suggest something for the developers, please search Github first. If the idea hasn't been suggested before, [open an issue](https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin/issues?state=open) for discussion. We're spending too much time trying to answer questions in reddit, and the answers are lost too quickly so we're constantly answering the same questions.

3. While yes the price has dropped, even against USD, our network hashrate has been holding solid at around 40GH/s, or about 20 times the hashrate of any coin I've heard of being 51% attacked.

4. For everyone claiming we're ignoring the community, we're not. If we were managing the coin in the dictatorial style you seem to think we are, we'd have had a revised mining schedule (""tapering"") two months ago when I first suggested it ( https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin/issues/318 ).

5. While still a good idea to use p2pool for new large miners (one or more high-end ASICs), for the smaller miners we have a good selection of smaller pools, please spread yourselves out. /r/dogemining/ can help you find good pools.

0.044,0.791,0.165,0.9978,"I have no idea if this is an appropriate forum to make this proposal.  Apologies if it is not.  Here goes:

The most common criticism levied against cryptocoins by economists is that they are doomed by deflation.  They are right.  A currency with an expanding user base that does not feature an increasing supply is toast.  This is a controversial topic in cryptocoin circles, I know, but it is crucially important.  Dogecoin does not need to inherit the deeply flawed economic ideas that Bitcoin has passed on to almost all other cryptocurrencies.

Let's make dogecoin one of the few exceptions to the silly rule of a fixed supply. This coin needs some amount of inflation after the initial 100,000,000,000 have been mined.  If we want to see ever-increasing adoption, we need ever-increasing supply.

Reasonable inflation:

* Allows the community to expand after initial quantity has been dug up.  With some inflation, the community can still grow without spiking the price.  Without inflation, we will either experience deflation in the community, where DOGE-denominated prices must continually fall, or a decline in dogecoin usership.  Deflation will cause the value to spike, inducing hoarding behavior and shutting new shibes out of the market.  This is the opposite of the dogecoin ethos.
* Deters some speculators.  I am not anti-speculator, as some speculation is both inevitable and healthy, but by baking in some supply inflation we may discourage ""pump and dump"" activity.
* Sets the understanding that dogecoin has a future beyond just the next few years.  With some inflation, Dogecoin could have a perpetual existence.  A currency without a future will be abandoned, even if it is cute and funny.  Dogecoin needs a future.

Even better than a baked in amount of inflation would be a mechanism for the block rewards to adjust in size along with transaction volume.  If Doge coin inflated in a manner that was consistent with usage, that would be ideal.  That feature alone would make dogecoin unique and give it an edge that no other cryptocurrency has: a rational guiding hand over the future of the money supply.  

Open questions remaining if we assume that adding inflation is a good idea:

* How much inflation would be good? 5%, 10%, or somehow peg inflation to overall usage?
* How do we introduce this idea to the shibes?
* Many technical questions that I can neither express nor answer.

I think we have an extraordinary opportunity here.  In Bitcoin circles, suggesting some inflation would get you lynched.  But I think the dogecoin community would rejoice that more Dogecoin would be entering existence on into the future.

I'm willing to put money where my snout is: I've got 1M doge in investment available to the devs if they decide to go forward with this idea.

All this is just my 2 dogecoins.  I'd love to hear anyone's thoughts on this idea.


TL;DR: Inflation would greatly benefit Dogecoin by giving it a future longer than the next 2 years, lending credence to the idea of dogecoin as a valuable asset to be adopted by the community in perpetuity.  Inflation would help mitigate hoarding behavior and would strengthen the doge ethos of sharing and openness.  Inflation would also help differentiate dogecoin from other coins and give it more economic viability.

EDIT:  Dogecoin actually does feature 5% inflation.  This is awesome news!  I am even more certain that dogecoin has a bright future.  See discussion of the inflation here: https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin/issues/23"
0.15,0.777,0.073,-0.9107,"The dev's are implementing Segwit [https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin/issues/1798](https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin/issues/1798) , with no input from the broader community, which will break dogecoin blocks into 2; the transactions in one block and the signatures in another.  This might make syncing nodes worse because the node has to match up signature data to block data.  We already are having trouble with syncing, partly I think because we have our proof of work on Litecoin chain which our nodes have to sync up as well.  So implementing  Segwit will turn dogecoin into a 3-layer protocol.

This will not significantly impact TPS, though it might increase it slightly.  This will not increase transaction speed.  This will harm node syncing issues.

So what problem are we trying to solve with implementing Segwit? Have we considered the downsides like what is listed above?"

Hey everyone!

I debated several formats for putting this all together and finally settled on a post here in hopes the right people pick up on it. I'm a digital accessibility advocate and was hoping to share some accessibility insights, suggestions, and tips for [the dogecoin website](https://dogecoin.com/) to increase the usability. I want to make the world a more accessible and equitable place and I hope my suggestions can give more people access to this wonderful community. Do Only Good Everyday, right?

Addressing accessibility issues on a website not only helps those with disabilities, but it increases the usability for EVERYONE and increases SEO (Search Engine Optimization)! 

I often use these examples when conducting digital accessibility trainings: 

- A wheelchair ramp leading into a building is great for those that are in a wheelchair, but can be used by anyone including a mother and stroller or a delivery person with a moving dolly. 

- We've all used those buttons next to doors that automatically open push-doors for us. Though they're intended for wheelchair bound people, they're also useful if you don't have access to your hands for any other reason (groceries, for example). Or, if you just don't want to touch the door. That's perfectly fine!

To start, I'd like to share some background on how I identify accessibility issues. Later, I'll break down the issues on the website including code snippets of how to fix the issue. You don't need to read all the jargon at the beginning. If you'd like to dive right in, feel free to jump down to the [3] Issues section.

---
##[1] Evaluation Standards
I used the [W3C's WCAG 2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/) as an evaluation standard for identifying accessibility issues. Specifically, I used the [level AA conformance level](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/conformance.html#uc-levels-head) as a baseline.

---
##[2] Evaluation Technique

In assessing the accessibility of a website, I use three methods to identify accessibility issues: Automated scanning, Manual review, and Screen reader testing

###[2.a] Automated scanning
I run several web evaluation tools to build a synthesis of accessibility issues. No one tool can pick up on everything and some tools are better than others at scanning things.

Here are some of the tools I use, in order of my recommendation. I don't always use all of them and sometimes one scan from one tool is enough to give me what I'm after.

[WAVE Evaluation Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/wave-evaluation-tool/jbbplnpkjmmeebjpijfedlgcdilocofh/related?hl=en) - Developed by WAVE.

[axe DevTools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/axe-devtools-web-accessib/lhdoppojpmngadmnindnejefpokejbdd/related?hl=en-US) - Developed by Deque.

[A11y Evaluation Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/a11y-html5-validator/cfgfmngpbhlaagbfjhellojpcpcjmnkl/related?hl=en) - Developed by A11y.

###[2.b] Manual review
Automated scanning cannot pick up on everything. Some things require human review to identify shortcomings. For example, image color contrast, reading order, font legibility.

I then disable .css on the webpage to see if the page still makes sense. If it doesn't, the markup of the page is incorrect and reader order will not be accurate for screen readers.

Next, I'll open the page in a few different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge) to make sure they all work similarly. I'll then use browser tools to see the page at different resolutions to ensure all the content is still functional. Given dogecoin.com uses Bootstrap (and subsequently flexbox), not much attention is needed here.

Finally, I use my keyboard to see if I can navigate the page and interact with all the content. [Here's a handy shortcut list for Chrome](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/157179?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en#zippy=%2Cwebpage-shortcuts).

###[2.c] Screen Reader

I use a couple of screen readers when navigating websites. [JAWS (Job Access With Speech)](https://www.freedomscientific.com/products/software/jaws/), [NVDA (NonVisual Desktop Access](https://www.nvaccess.org/), and the Apple VoiceOver software are the three that are used the 
most. I don't own a JAWS license, so I use Apple's VoiceOver software for this step. I'm really looking to see if I can make sense of the website without seeing what it looks like. Sometimes I'll set a few tasks for myself and see if I can complete them using the screen reader. For dogecoin.com, I wanted to see if I could learn about dogecoin and figure out who created the website using a screen reader. I was able to complete both tasks without issue, but there were other issues that I encountered along the way.

---
##[3] Issues
Here I'll break down the issues for each page and provide documentation on the WCAG 2.1 guideline the issue is referring to, as well as provide a recommended solution to the problem. I'll try to keep it simple.

I debated between sorting the issues chronologically on the page or grouping them by issue type. I ultimately landed on grouping them by issue type given most accessibility scanning tools do the same.

##### Missing image alternative text (x4)

**Overview**: Screen readers use image alt text to describe images.

*References*

- [WCAG 1.1 - Text Alternatives](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/text-equiv-all.html) 

- [Understanding 1.1.1](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/non-text-content.html)

&nbsp;

**1. [Navbar logo](https://i.imgur.com/O8d3Gbj.png)**

**Current Code**  
`<img src=""assets/img/dogecoin-300.png"">`

**How to fix**  
Add an ""alt"" tag with a text description to the image. For this instance, since there is text in the image, it's important to capture that text in the alt text

**Possible Code**  
`<img src=""assets/img/dogecoin-300.png"" alt=""Dogecoin"">`

&nbsp;


**2. [Multidoge Logo](https://i.imgur.com/K8jgNQW.png)**

**Current Code**  
`<img src=""assets/img/multidoge.png"" style=""max-width: 150px;"">`

**How to fix**  
Add an ""alt"" tag with a text description to the image. Avoid using terms like ""Image of..."" in the alt text. The voice over software will denote that the element is an image. Also note the space between ""Multi"" and ""doge"" in the suggestion below. Screen readers may try to join those words phonetically.

**Possible Code**  
`<img src=""assets/img/dogecoin-300.png"" alt=""Multi doge Logo"">`

##### Very low color contrast (x6)

**Overview**: Foreground and background colors that don't have a 4.5:1 color contrast ratio for 18px font may be difficult to see.

*References*

- [WCAG 1.4 - Distinguishable](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/visual-audio-contrast.html) 

- [Understanding 1.4.3](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/contrast-minimum.html)

**1, 2, 3 [Windows button color](https://i.imgur.com/uFwKCXY.png)**

**Current Code**  
`//From Bootstrap.css .btn-info { color: #fff; background-color: #17a2b8; border-color: #17a2b8;}`

**How to fix**  
This is actually a surprise to me. It looks like the website is using Bootstrap's default info color (#17a2b8) and Bootstrap is usually pretty good with accessibility. The color contrast for this button comes out to 3.04:1 which falls short of the required 4.5:1. It looks like the site is pulling Bootstrap from a third-party CDN so you have a few options on fixing this one. The easiest would be overwriting the .btn-info color in your styles.css with a slightly darker color.

**Possible Code**  
`//In styles.css .btn-info { color: #fff; background-color: #128091; border-color: #128091;}`

&nbsp;

**4, 5, 6 [Linux button color](https://i.imgur.com/rPCc3Gg.png)**

**Current Code**  
`//From Bootstrap.css .btn-success { color: #fff; background-color: #28a745; border-color: #28a745;}`

**How to fix**  
Similar to the info color, Bootstrap's default success color doesn't meet the 4.5:1 contrast ration with white text. Darkening the background color slightly should fix the problem.

**Possible Code**  
`//in styles.css .btn-success { color: #fff; background-color: #208337; border-color: #208337;}`

##### Missing H1

**Overview**: Headings facilitate page navigation for users of many assistive technologies. They also provide semantic and visual meaning and structure to the document. A first level heading (<h1>) should be present on nearly all pages. It should contain the most important heading on the page (generally the document title). Having a properly titled H1 also helps tremendously with SEO.

The <h1> should be before all other heading elements.

*References*

- [1.3.1 Info and Relationships](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#info-and-relationships)

- [2.4.6 Headings and Labels](https://webaim.org/standards/wcag/checklist#sc2.4.6)

**Possible Solution using in-line code**:

    <h1 class=""sr-only"">Dogecoin</h1>

The <h1> should be placed after the <nav> element. It can be placed as the first item in the <header> element. Note the use of the ""sr-only"" class. This is a Bootstrap class that hides the element visually (screen reader only).


&nbsp;

----

##### Links must have discernible text (x6)

**Overview**: Links that are images or icons should have a text alternative for screen readers

*References*

**How to fix**  
Add an aria-label attribute on the anchor. Note that the child image element has an empty alt tag. Since the image is wrapped in an anchor, we utilize the aria-label of the anchor to explain the image.

**Possible Code**

**How to fix**  
Add an aria-label attribute to each of the icons <i> elements.

    </div>

**How to fix**  
Add an aria-label attribute to the icon.

**Possible Code**
  
    <div class=""scroll-to-top d-lg-none position-fixed"" style=""display: block;"">
        <a class=""js-scroll-trigger d-block text-center text-white rounded"" href=""#page-top""><i class=""fa fa-chevron-up"" aria-label=""go back to the top of the page""></i></a>
    </div>

----

I would also recommend adding a ""Skip Navigation"" link to the top of the page. It's a common practice that allows assistive technology users to skip right to the content. Those without sight limitations often visually scan the main content of the page first. Adding a ""Skip Navigation"" link will provide a similar experience to those using assistive technology.

[Read more about Skip Navigation links](https://webaim.org/techniques/skipnav/)

**How to make a Skip Navigation**
Add a ""Skip Navigation"" link as the first element within the body (just before the nav) that links to your header section. Note the ""sr-only"" class from Bootstrap that hides the element visually.

`<a class=""sr-only"" href="".masthead"">Skip Navigation</a>`

0.038,0.889,0.073,0.9243,"Let me preface this by saying, I'm not a coder, don't know cryptography, and this could all be gobbledygook.

A month or two ago I discovered Solana used a blockchain clock to help resolve their network efficiency/security.

&#x200B;

I started thinking that perhaps this could also be used in the context of a proof-of-work model. Like if say, events had a proofed time, then orphan block fairness, maybe even the need for confirmations could be resolved.

&#x200B;

A lot of proof of work mechanisms are actually striving to resolve time using propagation as a proxy (which is slower), or network timings as a padding.  You don't know when transactions occur, so you use confirmations via propagation. You don't know when blocks are mined, so that constraints block-time. Time is worked around, because there is no absolute sense of time.

Solana uses a specific variation of a Verifiable Delay Function ([https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/601.pdf](https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/601.pdf)), in their words:

""*Our specific implementation uses a sequential pre-image resistant hash that runs over itself continuously with the previous output used as the next input. Periodically the count and the current output are recorded.*""

They use SHA-256, and apparently this implementation is pretty much impossible to parallelize (ie must run single core). I'm not honestly sure of Scrypt could be used in the same way.

It's explained here:

[https://medium.com/solana-labs/proof-of-history-a-clock-for-blockchain-cf47a61a9274](https://medium.com/solana-labs/proof-of-history-a-clock-for-blockchain-cf47a61a9274)

Because it's single core, and the speeds at which ASICs running SHA-256 are predictable, they can also approximate the bounds in which this can be speed up (30% or so). Making it, so within these boundaries, they can have certainty of it's honesty. As far as I understand it, because it's published, uses unique input data, and it's sequential, it cannot be modified retrospectively nor can the hashes be reused. Linked to specific events (ie with those events as input data), like transactions and blocks, it should make those events also non-malleable.

I heard that originally Satoshi actually wanted to implement a blockchain clock prior to settling on his solution for bitcoin. In a sense, proof of work acts as a clock. I wonder is this still possible to integrate a clock with tighter timing into a Proof-of-Work system?

I have no idea if this is doable, but it does seem to me one of the central design flaws of proof of work is not knowing time. If it was possible to create a reliably proofed time, some slower mechanisms could be replaced or eliminated. Orphan blocks, in theory at least would then come down not to centralization but how much lost work is tolerable to miners and the network - which in itself would come down to efficiency and network speed.

If confirmations aren't able to be eliminated, they could at least be reduced. Of course efficiency in blockchain propagation itself would be key - if there's too much variability, it would limit the use of this.

Please accept again, that I am not a coder, and I could have all this wildly wrong. I do grasp though that this would essentially be completely altering how the chain propagates and how immutable history functions, and is by no means a simple thing."
0.527,0.453,0.021,-0.9994,"One of the things that's not at all apparent when we do a major update, is how much checking there is that nothing's broken. Bitcoin Core (which we modify into Dogecoin Core) comes with a LOT of automated tests, which is great, but a lot of them work specifically around how Bitcoin does, so when we make small changes, there's like ten to one fixes to tests to verify everything.

As a true believer in decentralization (or really no middleman arbitrarily making decisions on limiting control), I, like many others want this coin to flourish...not because tipping is cool and memes are fun...which both are true...but because hundreds of thousands of Americans and millions around the world, who can‚Äôt afford it, have invested their savings and some their ‚Äúlife savings‚Äù into dogecoin believing it will be the first real ‚Äúglobal currency‚Äù used by the masses.

I have been talking recently with some artists friends about this whole NFT thing; while talking about that we touched on the subject of cryptos, and I perceived in general an overwhelming dislike among younger generations due to the negative effect on the environment that Proof of Work currencies have.

The discussion around this topic is raging, and as you have read many have underlined that the traditional banking sector is much worse on the environment than crypto mining - but in case cryptos become one of the tools within the banking sector, the problem would be compounded.

I wanted to ask with all candor if there has ever been a discussion in making Dogecoin more ""green"" than Bitcoin (I know that at this point Bitcoin's effect on the environment is much heavier than the one of cryptos like Litecoin or Doge), either by modifying the way the currency is mined (I know this would be probably close to impossible at this stage) or by creating an incentive to mine with green energy.

What is your take on this problem, which is important for all of us at this point? I saw several topics about this being downvoted in the past weeks at [r/dogecoin](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/), hence I decided to ask you.

1.21 is a major refresh of the code base using Bitcoin Core 0.21, to build future work on top of.  It is at very early stages, and is only intended for developers who can help us progress the client. The current focus is fixing automated tests which have broken while introducing Dogecoin changes, as a precursor to addressing an issue where block download fails after a node exits the initial block download phase.

With 4 days or so until AuxPoW becomes active, I just wanted to quickly go through the final preparations for the switchover. We're up to 57% of all nodes on 1.8, which is great, but still not the 100% we should be targetting.

If you're running a pre-1.8 client and for whatever reason are not updating before the switchover block (371,337, estimated for 11th September, late afternoon GMT), please shut it down over the next couple of days (before the 11th, anyway). If your client is open when the fork happens, it will both complicate the switchover, and your own later update process. Please remember that if you do not update, your client will no longer be able to send or receive coins with anyone on 1.8 after the fork, which includes a huge number of exchanges and services. This is not an optional update that you can wait and see with, all users must update at some point.

I'm aware of a very small number of users finding they cannot find any block sources after updating to 1.8; I'm optimistic this will resolve itself as the network updates to the same version, or will look at adding further diagnostics to the next release.

If you need support updating to 1.8, please do ask. If you can help others update, please do check /r/dogecoin, /r/dogecoindev, /r/dogeducation, the [BitcoinTalk thread](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=361813.msg8712364#msg8712364). We'll really need help when the switchover happens and shibes start asking why their coins aren't showing up (and remember this can be either the sender or receiver being on the wrong chain).

Lastly, I've just become aware there's a new coin using the Dogecoin name. They say imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, however there's only one Dogecoin, and any new coin does not have the same development, marketing, vendor or other support that comes with being Dogecoin.

I'm not a dev, but man do I appreciate all the hard work you've all been up to!

I had a couple of ideas I wanted to run by you all to see how difficult/crazy hard they'd be to make happen - and if anyone would be up for taking them on.

I've been thinking of ways to help get our Global Hashrate up, easily, without having to re-invent the wheel (change our algo, etc) - here's what I've come up with:

1. What would REALLY help us is if we could come up with a 1-click mining setup for newbs.
Drag and drop to desktop, double-click and you're CPU/GPU mining to an auto-generated wallet on a randomly selected p2pool.  Not sure how difficult this is - maybe some way to build it out of Kalroth/Cudaminer?

2. I also had an idea of a miner that was like SETI - mines in the background with unused GPU/CPU cycles - especially while AFK, moves to the background automatically as you need to use your computer.

Are these insanely difficult to pull off?  I think the SETI one would be fantastic because you can keep using your PC but if you take off for a bit, bam! Mining! ;D)

One-click mining would be great for newbies especially non-tech-minded ones.

Thank you all so much for your time, I know you're all probably quite busy.

0.147,0.725,0.128,-0.9867,"Hello all, there's a lot of reasonable discussion regarding transaction fees lately. Most of those claims are that transaction fees are too high, and make small transactions unreasonable. Folks are weighing in and saying that transaction fees should be in the 1/2 a cent range, or around 0.01 DOGE by current price (\~$0.5). Elon Musk, a business man and active Twitter user, has personally asked for a 100X reduction in DOGE fees (around 1/20 of a cent). I wanted to formulate a post to align the discussion around the metrics, and clarify why transaction fees exist.

**On the subject of transaction fees**: by associating a cost with a transaction (TX), you solve an important problem: you limit spam TXs which can be harmful to a cryptocurrency. With the current TX fee, DOGE is extremely spam-resistant. But, before we move on, there are two other considerations: (1) by including a fee, miners receive an additional payment outside of the typical block rewards (subsidy) and (2) you provide a means for TX speed competition, where miners are able to set personal limits on fees. Assuming wallets are implemented well, the miners will be able to compete (lowering fees to solve more transactions, like a company acquiring clientele) and you will get the best TX fee at any given time. In relation to spam, this will allow miners to lower their prices to attractive amounts - but won't remove the fee entirely, ensuring a spam attack isn't feasible. With the current relay strategy, this is not being encouraged as much as it could be. **Luckily, this is something the devs are aware of**. So the next part is basically going to be a scale of the considerations, and hopefully you can identify if there is anything I've missed.

Considerations \~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

**Miners**: miners aren't a priority in determining fees. While they do receive an additional payment from fees, it's a side-effect rather than a priority. A coin \*can\* exist without fees, or extremely low fees, and it will still have miners so long as they see a potential in the coin's appreciation, or if the coin has enough use-cases to be valuable and worth the mining process.

*IMO: Miners should not be considered when calculating fees. They should be happy with what they get! Which is roughly 70 DOGE per block currently.*

**Spam**: limiting spam is the #1 priority. So this becomes a vulnerability consideration; how much spam will harm the coin, who would want to do this harm, who has the ability to do this harm, and how can we prevent it.

*IMO: Threats could range all the way from a government (\~200 million USD) down to commercial bad actors (\~10 million USD) per attack. Commercial bad actors are the most likely threat vector. A coin is harmed by spam when the block space begins to fill each minute, and as a result the fee increases or disrupts node syncing. The DOGE max block size is 500Kb so the theoretical transactions per second would be 33 TX/s. At 1,980 TX/min, 1981 TX would begin to cause problems. The average TX/min is 22 TXs, so that would require roughly 1959 TX/min of spam, climbing towards 1980 TX/min. To truly affect the chain, this would need to occur, sustained, over multiple days/weeks/months.*

**Cost**: This sort of builds into the above. It can be built by two considerations: (1) how much spam would be required to harm the chain by increasing costs; once you know that you can estimate a cost-value with that. (2) How valuable is preventing spam? This one is less important, but will come into play when selecting a realistic threat.

The second big consideration for cost is, cost of using the coin. To be a realistic currency, using the coin shouldn't be a high cost relative to what you can buy. Because of this, the desire to keep fees low is strong.

*IMO: we should start with the second part of the first consideration and the second part of the whole consideration to form a baseline limit. Taxes are roughly 2.5-8% for everyday items. DOGE TXs should probably be less than that because then you are paying double taxes for each TX. But realistically, $0.01USD is unnoticeable, so we know the limit should be between $0.01 and 8% of a cup of coffee, or $0.16.*

*Next we can determine the cost of sustaining an attack for a series of time intervals at a series of costs. To describe the attack, it would take roughly $42,768,000 to fill 1980 TX/min @ 1DOGE (\~$0.5) ea. for one month. Considering a commercial bad actor with a sustained attack for a week, the cost associated with this scenario should be more than $10 million. If we consider that a cup of coffee is purchased for every TX (@$2/cup) that would amount to an 8% tax associated value of $3,193,344. If the $0.16 fee is used, it would bring the cost of a weekly attack to $13,885,344 which is above the limit of a commercial bad actor, but not unreasonable. At $0.01 TX fee, the total cost would be $10,891,584, which is fairly close to the potential threat. Given more detail and technical figures, we could probably draft a realistic scenario which facilitates a strong TX fee.*

Spam Solutions\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

Transaction fees are just one solution to the spam problem. Other solutions have been tried by other coins, such as the back-log process for Nano which they implemented recently in response to a spam attack. There is also the Throughput model, where a sending address must provide proof-of-work (PoW) on two other transaction, thereby turning the spammers into workers. There is the reputation model, which would require a central authority to grant reputation to approved senders (not at all recommended for DOGE).

Overall, there is some initial justification to decrease the TX fees, absent of other improvements to the process. Thoughts?

0.027,0.86,0.113,0.9935,"Hello guys,

I asked this question a while ago, and I was notified by one of the developers that I would have received a reply by the development team about this in a public thread. I am asking this again as I see a lot of misconceptions, also in well written articles, where it is constantly stated that Dogecoin development is entirely based on ""for free"" efforts and no funding is available to developers in case of need. This is often used as an example of the ""weakness"" of Dogecoin, also against other sister projects like Litecoin.

We know there is an official tip jar for Dogecoin development which holds around 24 million doge (1.4M USD at the current market price)**.** The developers can access it via a multisig wallet, so they must all accept/confirm a withdrawal. This is a big amount of money, and whenever I share this bit of information people are shocked and see the whole enterprise as more legitimate.

There is also a lot of confusion around the tipjar, as also this thread from a month ago shows ([https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoindev/comments/lkx2od/dogecoin\_devs\_what\_are\_your\_actual\_thoughts\_on/gnmrj81?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoindev/comments/lkx2od/dogecoin_devs_what_are_your_actual_thoughts_on/gnmrj81?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)); issues include wrong addresses in old threads (**in particular with an address still holding 14M Dogecoin in it, but of which even** u/rnicol **knows nothing about**) and stuff like that (u/rnicoll redacted some of those old threads now).

My questions are:

1. Can we advertise a bit more the existence of this quite sizeable tipjar, also for the press writing about Dogecoin?
2. What is the current strategy in the way this fund is being used? I know part of it is used to spin Dogecoin nodes when new versions are released, but is there some way to democratize access to this fund, so that for example the community can vote on how this fund is being used?

As an example, we have the recent [Dogecoin.com](https://Dogecoin.com) redesign, which is nicely done but could be pushed further with some additional funds, as they did with the [Bitcoin.org](https://Bitcoin.org) tipjar for the website, which allows them to iterate and work on the website much more frequently, also including interactive/blogging features when needed. Or it could be used to hire a professional UI/UX designer to streamline and simplify the wallet experience (I know, some veterans are against making the wallet too easy to use, but in general I do not agree).

I am all for the fun side of Doge, but I believe it is fundamental to deal with this aspect transparently - crystal-clear transparency - also for the possibility it might attract talents which just do not have the time to work for free but that might benefit the community as a whole.

And by ""attract talents"", I do not mean established, famous coders and designers, but also developers from disadvantaged backgrounds which might have great skills but cannot afford to lose even one day of work on an unpaid task due to their living expenses and financial situation.

Just let us know!

Edit: added further information about wrong tipjar funds links and about the possibility of attracting talents."

0.01,0.843,0.147,0.9986,"Doing something a little different today - I'm doing a pair of posts, one more general (over on /r/dogecoin at https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/32bsvv/dev_wallets/), one more technical (this).

Something that comes up at a lot is people wanting to get involved and not knowing where to start. The reference client can be more than a little intimidating to get involved with, but there's a number of libraries for various languages that make programming with cryptocurrencies easier. I'd love to see more projects using these libraries, and/or getting involved with their development:

* Java - [dogecoinj](https://github.com/langerhans/dogecoinj-new/), which powers the Android client and Multidoge
* Python - [python-bitcoinlib](https://github.com/petertodd/python-bitcoinlib) with [python-altcoinlib](https://github.com/rnicoll/python-altcoinlib)
* Ruby - [bitcoin-ruby](https://github.com/lian/bitcoin-ruby)

There's also a partial implementation of a Bitcoin node in C#, [BitSharp](https://github.com/pmlyon/BitSharp), which in time I'd love to see completed and adapted to be compatible with Dogecoin.

I really want to talk about dogecoinj and python-altcoinlib though. As you can see, for the Python version rather than either forking the project entirely (as dogecoinj does) or pushing altcoin support into the base library (as bitcoin-ruby does), python-altcoinlib uses much of the code from python-bitcoinlib, but does not directly modify the underlying library. As a result it's easier to follow changes in the underlying library (as long the API doesn't change, in theory it's still compatible) rather than requiring merges. This has historically been an issue for dogecoinj (a number of times langer_hans has rebuilt the library from bitcoinj rather than trying to merge patches), making it more difficult than it should be to introduce new technology.

I'm going somewhere with this, just bear with me a bit longer.

As I've talked about in my other post, hardware wallets are probably the best compromise for wallets in the longer term. They're designed to be more secure than desktop or web wallets, easily portable... and currently don't support Dogecoin. Multibit HD introduces support for Trezor (and I believe Ledger support is in the works), and as such Multidoge HD will be able to provide the same functionality. Multidoge of course depends on dogecoinj, so any work to make dogecoinj easier to maintain is therefore step in the right direction for hardware wallets for Dogecoin.

Which is why I've been working on adapting dogecoinj into a library that layers over bitcoinj. Currently using the name [altcoinj](https://github.com/rnicoll/altcoinj/) however that's also used for another project, so expect a rename before the end. If this works, it should reduce development effort required for this work, in an ongoing manner. So, to recap: Making dogecoinj easier to maintain to make Multidoge HD easier to maintain to make hardware wallet support easier. Got that? Good.

Other things going on right now - I've bought a Raspberry Pi 2. Right now I don't actually have a separate monitor or keyboard so can't get it set up until I move house and buy these items, but I want to see if I can make Raspberry Pi an officially supported platform, or at least produce a client binary that I've signed. These are really useful for two things; firstly, they make great full nodes (although storage is a bit of an issue given how fast the blockchain expands), and secondly they have [proper hardware random number generators](http://scruss.com/blog/2013/06/07/well-that-was-unexpected-the-raspberry-pis-hardware-random-number-generator/) making them ideal for generating keys offline (i.e. on an unconnected system) for use in cold storage (where the public key is taken off by thumb drive or similar, but the private key stays on the RPi).

Oh, one thing I forgot - if we have any Javascript experts who want to look into Ledger support, their wallet software (which is centralised for balance retrieval, but very easy to use) is available on Github at https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-wallet-chrome . The [BTChip docs](https://ledgerhq.github.io/btchip-doc/bitcoin-technical.html) seem to suggest that in the normal mode, the chip can only be used with a single network (because you set address type at setup), though, so for now you'd need a separate device for each coin you want to work with. As I've talked about earlier, forking projects leads to undue work merging commits in later, so if you're going to look at this, please try to re-use the existing wallet software where possible rather than forking and making an incompatible version.

0.027,0.921,0.052,0.8047,"Langerhans will arrange for a Doge ""statoshi"" node to be doing data capture through the test, for additional monitoring. Plan is more or less:

* 1700 GMT: rnicoll starts 6 new EC2 m3.large nodes, split equally across Ireland, Oregon and North Virginia regions. These nodes automatically sync to testnet and act to boost the network size. Nodes sync time using NTP Nodes are configured to log arrival time of each block for later comparison, using the blocknotify option
* 1800 GMT: rnicoll starts 3 further EC2 m3.large nodes, one in each of the above regions, and configures them to mine to a common output address.
* 1900 GMT: plddr starts flooding network with ~15 transactions per second to provide a background level of traffic
* 1900 GMT - 2000 GMT: Network stress test runs
* 2000 GMT: plddr stops flooding network
* 2000 GMT - 2100 GMT: rnicoll collects logs from nodes, pushes them onto Google drive for sharing, shuts down non-miners

* 2130 GMT: Oregon mining node shut down
* 2145 GMT: North Virginia mining node shut down

What you can do: We need more nodes. As many testnet nodes as we can get. Don't have to be fast or good (kind of better if they're not), just needs to be synced before we start the stress test. We need more transactions too, although that's actually less of a concern (easier to automate), but if you can throw transactions around while we test, that would be great.

0.039,0.853,0.108,0.9963,"So, there's three really big, mutually exclusive, themes to change requests for the coin:

* Change proof of work algorithm
* Proof of stake
* Merged mining (with Litecoin or similar)

Lets say (because I think it's about right from the polls we've seen done), each of these have 30% approval. So, while there's some overlap, lets call that 80% approval for change. As a result, if we pick any single option, we're going to have 70% of the community annoyed at us. If we do nothing, we disappoint 80%, although at least stuck to the original description of the coin. This is why we've held off while we discuss and analyse in depth, before announcing intent to make any change.

With this in mind, we're continuing to warm to the idea of some proof of stake variant, switching somewhere past the 600k block. Note that as a timescale that's at least another 6 months. A lot of discussion has gone on, a lot of issues but some good ideas have been proposed on how we resolve them. Key goals for why we're doing this, and how it will be approached:

1. Stabilise the coin without depending on conventional mining (which is highly price dependent).
2. Reduce wastefulness in the mining process.
3. Give miners the best chance possible to achieve return on investment.
4. Ensure the staking process is as stable as possible.
5. Minimise disruption caused by the switch-over.

We're not leaping head-first into this; coin simulation tools are going to be written, to enable modelling of various approaches (PoS, PoS 2.0, PoSV, PoT, etc.), look at strengths and weaknesses, attempt to minimise risks of unexpected forks (as other coins have had with recent technology changes). There's still plenty of time for discussion, but we wanted to let you know we're here, we're paying attention, and we're doing something.

Next up; anonymity, the hot new feature in a lot of coins. Lets first talk about how anonymity works in Bit, Lite, Doge and other similar coins. When an address is generated, it's not associated with anyone. However, there is a public ledger (the block chain) of all transactions. Therefore, when you make an address known to belong to yourself, for example to allow tipping to it, or payment from an exchange, anyone can tell how much money has been sent to that address.

The obvious answer is to move the money to an address that's not publicly known... however that movement is also visible, so this doesn't really help. Instead, anonymisation is supported by something called ""change addresses"". When you receive Dogecoin, the amount you've received is stored in a transaction. When you spend Dogecoin, the client chooses transactions to spend, such that they exceed the value of the Dogecoin being sent. Transactions received at an address have to be spent as a whole (they're indivisible), however.

So, lets say you receive 50 doge, then another 50 doge, then want to spend 75 doge. Both transactions are spent, and you have 25 doge (I'm ignoring transaction fees for simplicity) left over. That change is sent to a new address, called a ""change address"". The theory is that in doing so, it's hard to tell which Dogecoin were spent, and which were change (and remained with the sender). Bitcoin have a good page discussing this and other ways of improving anomymity: https://bitcoin.org/en/protect-your-privacy

This is all why it's important to use new addresses when receiving coins (especially for merchants, so your customers can't identify each other by looking for other coins going to the same address). There's also some issues with the change address system as currently implemented, in that typically the change is the smaller output of the transaction, which means it's possible to make statistical inferences over which output remains with the sender, and from that infer other transactions later on.

Darkcoin and similar resolve this by having much stronger anonymity, however this comes at a cost. The same openness of transactions in the blockchain allowed for some auditing of Bitcoins under Mtgox's control (for example http://www.coindesk.com/gox-money-moving-through-block-chain/). It enables external auditing of funds held by companies (as they can sign messages to show they control specific addresses). It assists hugely with debugging of wallet problems (for example, confirming coins are received successfully), a task which is already challenging to perform in cryptocurrency.

So we opt for a balance; we're looking at better coin choosing algorithms to make it harder to statistically determine which addresses are change and which are ""genuine"" payments. Meanwhile please use new addresses for each transaction where possible.

Lastly, we need to talk about developer motivations. The core development team does not have large Dogecoin holdings, and while there is a development fund, at the moment the amounts paid are relatively small. There is nothing wrong with this, however it's important to understand that this model attracts developers who are not directly motivated by the money. That's good in many ways, but many in the community are displeased that we're not focusing efforts on the price.

You are, as always, welcome to contribute code, or to recruit further developers who contribute such code, or to work on adoption, or to add services that use Doge, if you wish to encourage the value of Doge. The price is not, however, the primary motivation of your existing core devs."
0.018,0.834,0.148,0.9942,"I've seen quite a few people on various subs and social media suggesting the idea of including bounties for completing helpful projects that advance work on the coin. I've engaged in a few productive conversations about this and here is my suggestion for how it could possibly work.

Before this is brought up- I have seen that there is a developer fund that compensates contributing developers upon a major release. However I wonder if an individualistic approach to these rewards could be more motivating, as it is often a fairly large amount of time between major releases.  Visible, scaling rewards could assure them that they will receive something timely that is appropriate to their contribution.

I understand that the major problem whenever funding projects is brought up is that the Developers rightfully do not want to be beholden to any one entity. Retaining decentralization is vital, it is what this is all about after all. So there are two ways I could see this working.

The core Developers supply projects for the community to engage in at varying levels. Upon completion and pending review, a reward is given which is scaled to the complexity of the project, time spent, etc. These variables could be decided on by the devs before the bounty is issued, and the guidelines for successful completion could be posted for anyone wanting to attempt to complete the bounty, so that there is no confusion. This could help motivate more progress (and more effective, focused help) without compromising any of our ideals.

Or

The community decides what projects they want to work on. After completion of a project, the core Developers vote together to decide whether a given project is helpful or not. Then, rewards are decided on and scaled to usefulness (a tier system could be implemented to measure this), project complexity, etc.

Initially I had considered this working from a broader consensus..but I understand that the devs would probably want the voting parties to be subject matter experts. That said, I do believe that some sort of additional organizational infrastructure can be built here without risking centralization or involving any hierarchy that does not already exist.

Finally, if this is a redundant post I apologize, I've tried to comb through and see if this has been brought up before (and in how much detail) but there is a lot to read through atm. I just wanted to spark some helpful conversation. As has been said before, thanks for all you do guys. I'm really happy to see the community at large engaging in these projects and I hope I can find plenty of ways to help moving forward."
0.071,0.895,0.034,-0.9811,"With the AuxPoW fork now just under two weeks away, I wanted to talk about the what to do in case of problems. These are all per-user level issues, the main network risk would be if we didn't achieve at least 50% of nodes on 1.8 before the fork; given we‚Äôre at 48.7% now I think we can presume we‚Äôll hit that.

First of all, some of you may be holding off on updating to 1.8 because you‚Äôre expecting another client to come out and figure you‚Äôll wait for that. That new client is 1.8.1 and it is specifically scheduled to come out after the AuxPoW fork. What that means is your existing client will stop being part of the main chain, before the update comes out. My personal estimate is that 1.8.1 won‚Äôt be out until October

Lets say however that you don‚Äôt manage to update before the fork, because you‚Äôre busy, don‚Äôt find out in time, whatever what happens next? Well, the ideal scenario is you‚Äôre not running your client when the fork happens; just grab the 1.8 client, update, run it, wait for the re-index to happen, and it should be fine. If you know you can‚Äôt update in time but do have access to your client, please shut down your wallet before the 11th September, to reduce the number of broken nodes active on the network.

If your client is running after the fork, you‚Äôll now be on the wrong fork. This means that any coins you send to those on the main fork will not show up, and equally any coins they send you will not show in your client. If you‚Äôre mining on the wrong fork, any coins mined will simply be lost. First thing to try is simply update down and seeing if the client fixes itself:

1. Back up your wallet file (‚ÄúFile‚Äù menu -> ‚ÄúBackup Wallet‚Ä¶‚Äù) just in case
2. Shut down your client
3. Update to the latest client
4. Start the new client
5. Wait for the re-index to complete
6. You‚Äôll initially be on the wrong fork, but your client should pick up the new fork and correct itself. I‚Äôd suggest leaving it overnight to see if this works.
7. Any transactions on the wrong chain *will be lost*. That‚Äôs why we tell you to update before the fork. If you sent coins, you can re-send them once the resync has finished.

Okay, lets say your client doesn‚Äôt hop to the new fork; you‚Äôll have to rebuild your whole block database. So:

1. Back up your wallet file as above
2. Shut down your client
3. Delete your blocks from disk. These are in the %AppData%\Dogecoin directory on Windows, ""~/.dogecoin"" on Linux. You want to delete the folders ""blocks"" and ""chainstate"", and the file ""peers.dat""
4. Download a bootstrap file from https://bootstrap.chain.so/ and place it into the folder above, where the ""blocks"" and ""chainstate"" folders were.
5. Run your client. A full resync takes a few hours, so you may want to sleep or something. Note that as with a re-index, your transactions won‚Äôt show up until the client has resynced the blocks containing them, so initially it will show with a zero balance.
6. As above, any transactions on the wrong chain will be lost.

Lastly, if you do update and any coins you send/receive don‚Äôt make it, it most likely means the other side hasn't updated. Nag them to do so; we've contacted somewhere over 100 merchants and service providers, but we can‚Äôt get everyone individually!

it looks like Dogecoin could have an update!

What are your ideas?

The first thing that comes to my mind is the miner block reward. I think the coin has now enough distribution and it's time for a hard cap.

To implement that, I'd propose to simply go back to the Bitcoin block reward halvening scheme, and cap it at some point to zero. The point ion time where it goes to zero should be at least 1 year after the bitcoin block reward goes to zero, to see how BTC deals with that situation. It will obviously depend on the fees at that point.

But if one is already at it, many other modernizations or innovations are possible.

0.105,0.804,0.091,-0.9023,"Seeing Coinbase open up their wallet app to allowing not only Doge but Testdoge is really inspiring.

Getting to know someone from the third world has really opened up my eyes and really has been life changing realizing that not only do many make $4 a month wages, but that a dozen eggs still costs $2 and a kilo of meat costs $6.  That is what hardship really looks like.  Many people in these countries use crypto as literally their savings accounts, somewhat gambling that it goes up so they can get out of poverty.

So my focus is not how we can help rich get richer, but how do we provide a lower point of entry for doge to help out hundreds of millions struggling worldwide that own crypto?

Testnet is obviously for testing.  It is less stable and we can test changes there before the changes go live.  But what we have learned over the last decade (mostly from Bitcoin), is that testing a change on the testnet really doesn't accomplish much since there is no incentive to attack it. That is why Litecoin has volunteered to test changes for bitcoin on their own live network.

What if we could make testdoge a real living breathing testnet?  How would we get it there?  Simple.  Just announce that we won't ever reset the network.  We could always hardfork it to test a change, but we would keep the ledger intact.  If people had confidence they would not loose their coins because the devs got mad that people were trading them, then people would take the time and effort to use the testnet.  Bitcoin got mad that people were trading test bitcoins so they deleted everyone's coins, and now test bitcoin is dead and it doesn't even function as a testnet in many ways.

Even if we did this testdoge would be at least an order of magnitude cheaper than doge, and at least an order of magnitude easier to mine so these types of testing would still be viable.  And also it would open up the network as an incentive for attackers to attack, so it could actually function as a proper testnet.  If this was the case we could test fees and see what the min fee is so we don't get dust spammed, etc.  As it stands these kinds of tests cannot be done on testdoge because no one uses it.

Since no one uses testnet, I have been syncing for a few days straight and have just barely got the headers downloaded and have 3 million blocks left to download.  I have around 0-8 connections (usually around 1-3) compared to up to 120 connections on the mainnet. With 3 million blocks to download, I am getting just a couple  blocks per second.  So currently it doesn't even allow people who want to perform tests to use it.  The announcement I am proposing would change that instantly.

Just so you know I am not doing this for financial gain, if this is done then I will donate every single of my million testdoge coins.  Also I will host the blockchain so others can download it quickly (If I can ever get synced :).

Another thing that could be done is set up a tipbot for the dogecoindev reddit for donating testdoge coins.

In conclusion, just one simple announcement, that no one's testdoge will ever be reset or deleted, regardless if people start trading it; would go miles into making testdoge a viable test network and will benefit the poorest in the world.  This is beyond a doubt the most influential thing that we could ever do.  Also this would bring even more seasoned crypto people into the Doge community because we are so progressive on this front."
0.086,0.71,0.204,0.9958,"As of today, I, Sporklin no longer have any association or ties to The Dogecoin Project nor to the Dogecoin Core Developers.

After over seven years of assisting, helping, coding, engaging with users and educating the time has come for me to step away.Years are like eternities in the cryptospace, teams often shift or change where Dogecoin has maintained a stable team. 

Years is also a rather long time, where people change. Not in malicious ways but in manners where expectations, desires, and motivations change. Due to this I personally feel that there is no longer a place where I fit in the cohesive and functional group in a manner that aligns with their shifting ideals. This is not inherently bad, with change comes growth and new things even. Developmental groups in crypto are loosely based on agreed ideals, desires or directions. When this fractures there is friction in ways that become unproductive and unhealthy.

In not putting blame any where a shift happened recently that has caused me to reconsider my engagement due to my personal ethics, morals and concerns for the overall userbase. I cannot be part or not support in good faith the actions being taken as I see them harmful, damaging and threatening to the project that thousands of people have worked on for over half a decade, as well as the underlying engagement that millions of users have used in dedicated ways. This does not mean they are that via intention, I have always been the more cautious and protective developer as I worked closely with the community. Simply differing directional opinions that I cannot support.

Simply my ever ongoing desire to be clear with the users whom many of which have become friends over the years. In that effort a few users have become aware that something was going on with me due to less engagement during a time when there should have been more. To give this full clarity, during a very recent trip to the ER I became aware that I have an advanced form of cancer that has already aggressively spread. Chemo, radiation and ongoing treatment are hoping to improve my pretty abysmal 40% odds of survival.

Currently my health needs to take priority along with working towards getting better. *Today they made me radioactive, I did not glow like Mr.Burns; very sad panda*

Some background: I've been following the whole GameStop scene very closely and the players that are involved (Citadel, RH, Point72, etc.) have also had their hands in crypto. I have my own theories on how these institutions are laundering money in crypto to move stock prices, so I wanted to dig deeper into it by analyzing transaction histories on a few initial wallets. While I've tried pulling out info using wallet viewers and block viewers(like: [https://bitinfocharts.com/dogecoin/](https://bitinfocharts.com/dogecoin/)), my project is going to require that I analyze thousands of transactions and potentially hundreds of accounts, so manually scraping data is not reasonable. 

I've installed DogeCoin Core and I'm currently up to date with the blockchain and I'm currently running python 3.7 on a Windows 10 PC. My first instinct was to try and directly access the blockchain files, like any other .csv data file, but of course it's not quite that simple. Are there any libraries for python that will allow me to parse DogeCoin blocks and pull out transaction data? Since I have the blocks stored locally, are there any libraries that will let me parse them offline? If I have to be connected to the network, do I need to fully host a node to run queries on accounts?

I also plan to analyze Ethereum and possible BitCoin if my program can scale up those larger networks.

so..

examples:

sending 1 Doge x 0.001 = 0.001 Doge fee / 0.999 received

sending 10 Doge x 0.001 = 0.01 Doge fee / 9.99 received

sending 100 Doge x 0.001 = 0.1 Doge fee / 99,9 received

sending 1.000 Doge x 0.001 = 1 Doge fee / 999 received

sending 10.000 Doge x 0.001 = 10 Doge fee / 9.990 received

sending 100.000 Doge x 0.001 = 100 Doge fee / 99.900 received

sending 1.000.000 Doge x 0.001 = 1000 Doge fee / 999.000 received

this is the only way keeping the usage as a currency alive.

with a system like that it also makes sense tipping small amounts of Dogecoin like in reallife giving just a few cents / dollars.

people with daily / small amount pay very low fees

rich people pay much higher fees for moving / selling lots of coins.

we already have the problem that few adresses have too many coins and over the years i think fees with a system like that will make it very fair.

**What is Flappy Doge?**

I was never a fan of Flappy Bird clones, so I decided to make my own (kinda ironic). The difference is you play as a doge, collect dogecoins, and hodl doge.

**Whats new?**

Been making some good progress, and it's finally starting to feel like a playable game. I spent most of the week building a foundation for the project (API stuff, manager scripts, playerprefs etc..) . Making the assets took FOREVER. I've never done pixel art before so it's a major learning curve for me.

* Created a completely new set of assets.
   * If you saw my last dev log you know why.
* Changed the old scoring system to collecting doge.
* Added CoinGecko API to get the DOGE:USDT conversion rate in realtime.
   * Used it to display your doge value in USD.

**Whats next?**

I need to add some playability to the game. As of now, it's REALLY boring. I figured if you spend all your time collecting DOGE, you need some way to use it. In the following week, I will start looking into a portfolio management system. Here are some of the things I plan to do:

* Add a way to accumulate DOGE.
* Adjust your earnings based on the size of you're portfolio.
* Add incremental difficulty.
* Add an earning multiplier the further you go in one run.
* Idea: Add a rare shiny dogecoin that pays more DOGE.

I have a lot of ideas for the near future. I was thinking about adding a way to save your doge and earn interest somehow. I will keep you updated!

**Have a fantastic day**

If you guys enjoyed this let me know and I will continue writing updates. The game is still in early development, but I will be creating a Google Play page soon so you can follow it. Hope you guys like the progress!"

0.139,0.832,0.029,-0.9885,"Shibes, we have a problem. The Dogechain is too long. We are running into the problem that will someday doom Bitcoin: the blockchain will get too long for many peers to maintain. Centralized solutions to caching the chain will only defer this problem and give us more vulnerability.


We need to do something new and different. We only really need the last 10,000 (or maybe less) blocks in the chain to make block spoofing damn near impossible. In the 4k blocks after that, all we need is the unspent outputs from those blocks. Rather than keeping those whole blocks, we can create an archive of just those outputs. Each new block describes a list of additions and removals to this ‚Äúdogepile‚Äù. We then add a new field to dogecoin blocks: We apply the removal and additions of outputs indicated by an unpublished block then hash the dogepile of unspent outputs. We put this hash into the blocks, so users can always validate their archive of unspent outputs. 


When the doge-chain is loaded by a new peer, the peer is sent the ‚Äúdogepile‚Äù and then the last 10k or so blocks in the chain. By the time it has finished loading the dogechain, our ‚Äúdogepile‚Äù is likely a few blocks out of date, so the client can update it accordingly and confirm its hash against the one given in the blockchain.


New transactions, rather then checking for a double-spend of an output, check to see if an output is even present in the dogepile. If a referenced output for a new transaction is not in the dogepile when it's block is added it is either a double spend or an invalid output, the response of a peer in either case is the same.


So, shibes: This is the point where you all need to post and say what is horribly wrong with this scheme, and maybe we can refine it into a working solution.

0.019,0.858,0.123,0.9869,"**ISSUE**

CGMiner GPU settings are not intuitive to properly allow a user to get the best hash out of their particular card.  Each individual GPU has a 'best setting' that often does not perfectly translate to another card of the same model.  There is a huge demand for assistance in determining the best settings for each card.

**DISCUSSION**

I think there's enough evidence to suggest that simply maxing out a GPU's overclock settings is not necessarily the best way to get the highest performance. 

[Graham Forest](http://obsoleet.org/resources/dogecoin/tuning.html) discovered this a few years ago and built a very good histogram of the results.  He wrote a simple program to test a huge range of possibilities and find the area of best results.  His program [cgminer2rrd](https://github.com/vitaminmoo/cgminer2rrd) includes much of the capability required

The [cgminer 3.7.2 SCRYPT-README](https://raw.github.com/ckolivas/cgminer/v3.7.2/SCRYPT-README) notes this.  Spinx on the [bitcoin forum](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=204949.0) also makes a note of this ratio.

In my own case, I found several ratios between gpu-engine and gpu-memclock that resulted in best performance.  [Here's a data table I made.](http://i.imgur.com/sQdEmO3.jpg)  Altering this ratio by even a small amount drastically affected hash rate.  

I found the same thing with intensity.  -I 14 resulted in significantly lower performance than -I 13.

**RECOMMENDATION**

I propose a software solution that will test a range of value combinations and create a visual representation of the results. 

**Record/Display test values**

* Record the hash rate, --gpu-engine, --gpu-memclock, temperature, A, R, and HW values.
* Generate tables and graphs of the results for the user
* Display 2 to 5 ""best option"" results as a range and median
* Output to display or write a text/csv file

**Test a range of GPU/Memory value ratios**

* Start at 1:1 and increment the ratio by .065 each step.  
* Allow the user to specify an increment
* Start at the default --gpu-engine and increment each step by 5
* Allow the user to specify a --gpu-engine increment value
* Test a range of settings independently on each of multiple GPUs
* Calculate the time required to perform the test

**Test a range of Intensity settings**

* Start at -I 8 and increment by 1 up to 20

**Test Duration**

* Calculate the time required to perform the test and display it to the user
* Run each combination for 30 seconds and record the results in first pass mode
* Run several user selected values, or the ""best option"" values for a longer duration.


**NOTES**
I'm just a guy who noticed a problem and found a good starting place for a solution.  I'm not a programmer, but am experienced in working with developers to create software solutions.

**TL;DR**
Make a program that will auto test a range of cgminer configurations."

""Thanks for your interest! I've always loved doge and it continues to be my second favorite crypto to this day :)

A two-way-peg definitely seems like a decent approach that opens the door to using DOGE with ethereum contracts but at the same time doesn't inflict platform risk on your community. Basically, the approach would be on the ethereum side to modify btcrelay into dogerelay (the hardest part there being implementing scrypt in EVM code; realistically you'd probably have to spread out the verifier over multiple transactions, and use a security deposit scheme so that you don't actually have to run verifications most of the time), and then create an ethereum contract where you can burn 1 DOGE to create 1 E-DOGE.

To convert back you let people burn E-DOGE in a way that generates a receipt, and then have a voting mechanic in the blockchain where ethereum-aware miners can vote +1 or -1 on the blockchain regarding whether or not each receipt is valid. Once a receipt reaches +100, the recipient gets 1 DOGE (this mechanic is essentially borrowed from Paul Sztorc's drivechain proposal). This mechanic could be implemented in a way that is a soft-fork on the dogecoin side, and only a contract on the ethereum side."""

I have a deployed 1.21 node, which is good, although there's definitely work be be done on 1.21 still:

* The deployed node syncs headers but it does not appear to request blocks from its peers. Even more confusingly, running 1.21 on my local machine _does_ sync blocks.
* Bitcoin Core 0.21 (which Dogecoin Core 1.21 is based on) is designed for DNS seeds which support version bits, ours do not, which means it reports that it finds zero nodes from the seeds. Work on enabling our DNS seeds to support this is already underway.
* Dogecoin Core 1.21 does not appear to discover nodes at all, right now, although if nodes are manually added, or connect _to_ the node, it works.
* The functional test suite needs validating after AuxPoW has been added, which may resolve some of these bugs as a side-effect.

Once those are out of the way, there's a bunch of more minor things to tweak so we can start mainnet testing, and then rebranding.

Fee work in 1.14.4 continues, I believe that's in testing, hoping Michi & Max will have further updates on that.

Obviously with Elon talking about environmental impact that's something that's being discussed. As we share work with Litecoin we already reduce that impact, compared to mining either cryptocurrency alone, but definitely it would be good if we can further reduce that impact. Counterpoint, I am aware that many in the community enjoy mining and feel it‚Äôs a key part of the experience for them, as well as considerations of whether an approach such as proof of stake would make Dogecoin appear to be a security and fall under securities regulation aside from many technical challenges that approach brings.

What I mean is, we‚Äôre aware of it, we don‚Äôt have any easy answers.

Meanwhile I‚Äôm going to continue work on the automated test suites, which hopefully will as a result simplify diagnosing the networking issues with 1.21, and it in turn should provide a better synchronization process."

1. For everyone asking; yes, you will have to upgrade to 1.8. Detailed walkthroughs (maybe even video) of how are coming. There's a shed load of other improvements in 1.8 anyway, so it's a really good idea. An alert will go out over the network when 1.8 is ready for general release, as well as all the normal channels (reddit, forums, Twitter, Steam, etc.) If you're running Multidoge or the Android wallet, both will also have updates shortly.

2. You will have to reindex your blocks when you first upgrade. It sucks, we know, and takes about 20-30 minutes. If you run the desktop client (Qt) you'll be prompted, if you're running the dogecoind you'll need to use the -reindex command line option on first run only.

3. ""Safe mode"" no longer trips from an hour before the hard-fork, to 24 hours after. That means as long as we get an AuxPoW block in that 24 hour range, and a good pickup of the 1.8 client, we shouldn't have any problems with needing to manually disable then re-enable safe mode. Hopefully the improved safety triggers written in over the weekend will prevent many problems even if this doesn't, but good to be sure.

4. AuxPoW-related RPC commands no longer function at all before the switchover block. If you need to test them, you can of course do this on testnet.

As /u/langer_hans has said elsewhere, we're hoping for a beta release today or soon thereafter (AFAIK this is just waiting on seeing if any problems appear in testing, and then Gitian builds being done).

So far, I have all of the parts implemented and independently tested, and pushed back to Coinbase for them to review.

I made a post yesterday looking for some people to test an app, and several Shibes replied! (https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/2s79wd/im_looking_for_some_geeky_shibes_to_private_beta/)

I am now trying to see if I can find some developers out there that would like to take an early peek at the API that powers the app. This API is a public API, so anyone could build something like the app we've build - you just need to integrate to this API.

The API is OAUTH 2.0 based for authentication flow.

It works very similar to how the Twitter, Facebook and other popular API's that use OAUTH. The OAUTH process is 100% standard OAUTH flows, any library should be able to use it (I use DotNetOpenAuth for my clients)

You will need to be able to use OAUTH to test this. The API's are simple REST based. The documentation I have for them is very basic at the time as well, but it does explain it ;)

PM me if you'd like to check it out. Create some dummy accounts and I'll throw you some DOGE and you can play around. Send the coins around, withdraw, tip them, anything you want. The API is there for you to create anything you want.

I hope these API's will usher in a new era of digital currency based applications. I've spent many months building this platform and I think developers are going to love it. It works with many coins as well, not just Doge.

I am very open to any feedback as well. I'd like to make a better product if you have suggestions. After all, the API is only used by developers, not end users ;)

Went to sync up Dogecoin recently to find the network was a literal mess; also found the actual core software is trailing behind Bitcoin by a large amount, which will only contribute to the problem.

So i've gone ahead and ported the core basics over to Bitcoin 0.21; which includes basic auxpow/header functionality, as well as the basic Dogecoin consensus ruleset (and tidied some admittedly average code up). Additionally with the introduction of the feefilter; there is no longer a need for the custom feerate code. Sometimes it makes sense to 'start again' rather than continue hacking away on a repository that has already seen a lot of rebasing/merging.

The coin runs considerably quicker, but will only improve as people switch over. Improvements are welcome via PR, I will continue to work away on it in my spare time but anyone is free to run with it if they find it useful. Yes, there will be plenty of Bitcoin references and logos etc. Note: No binaries, as thats a fantastic way to get yourself into trouble.

Bit of a history lesson here, but first what is coinbase maturity? When a miner mines a block, they get a reward. To encourage chain health, they don't get that reward immediately, instead there's a maturation period before the reward is available to spend. This encourages them to build more blocks (get reward faster), for example.

Dogecoin when first launched it had a maturation period of 30 blocks, or about half an hour. This turned out to be too low, which led to a bunch of risks we hadn't expected, so it was raised to 240 blocks (4 hours). Bitcoin uses 100 blocks, so we now have three different values (30, 100, 240) floating around.

The functional tests in Bitcoin are built around that 100 block value, which means a lot of assumptions they make on behaviour break when Dogecoin values are introduced. Adding more complexity, the Bitcoin test framework pre-generates 200 blocks spread over 4 nodes (so 50 each), however different tests use different numbers of nodes, so some tests start at 200 blocks, some at 100, some at 50. Simply increasing that pre-generated bundle by 140 (to maintain 100 matured nodes, after the 240 block maturation period) breaks a bunch of tests where they expect block height to be one value, and it's now another.

Increasing the block height naively in tests doesn't work, because features such as SegWit are enabled at defined heights, so again tests find features enabled ""too early"" and break. Changing coinbase maturation on RegTest to 100 blocks would be simpler, but we'd miss any impact from coinbase maturation period on, say, mempool behaviour.

Bonus round; the way the coinbase switch-over is implemented is inconsistent, so some tests see the 30 block maturation period AND the 240 block maturation period, and never work.

Currently looking at:

* Using a single maturation period of 240 blocks in all RegTest tests.
* Adding 140 blocks to the cached set of blocks produced by the test framework.
* Updating expected heights in tests to match.
* Cleaning up remaining breaking cases.

You can see the various experiments in the PR https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin/pull/1780

* Increasing feature activation heights by 140 blocks to compensate."

[Switch to Proof of Interaction, an algorithm that requires small amount of computational power while being secure. \[feat\] ¬∑ Issue #2059 ¬∑ dogecoin/dogecoin (github.com)](https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin/issues/2059)

**Full paper here:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.07763](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.07763)

*Proof of Interaction* requires a small amounts of computational power that is resistant to selfish mining. In addition, it solves the issues of Proof of Work's computational power and Proof of Stake's security issues.

**How it works**

""when a user wants to access a resource in a server that is heavily requested, the server can ask the user to perform a tour of a given length in the network. This tour consists of accessing randomly a list of nodes, own by the same provider as the server. After the tour, a user can prove to the server that it has completed the task and can then retrieve the resource.""

**Here are some keypoints:**

* Uses less computational power than Proof of Work
* More secure than Proof of Stake
* Resistant to selfish mining, meaning everyone is equal, doesn't matter whether if Bob has a more powerful computer than Alice.

So far, no proof of concept was currently made for the algorithm. This thread is a continuing discussion.

0.037,0.888,0.075,0.9496,"Think back to the Dogeparty burn - here Dogecoins are burnt to form currency on a new chain, in a one-way transaction. For Dogecoin on Ethereum, we want to be able to move Dogecoins back from the Ethereum chain. To do that, rather than burning coins we freeze them, resulting in a generate on the sidechain, and later we burn the coins on the sidechain to thaw the frozen coins on the main chain.

Looking at how Elements sidechains work, they've used a federated peg to avoid a soft-fork to introduce a side chain work verification op-code. They do however talk about the possibility of an OP_SIDECHAINPROOFVERIFY in the [sidechains whitepaper](https://blockstream.com/sidechains.pdf). We have to soft fork to add OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY anyway, so adding a new op-code with that fork seems highly practical.

This gives us a basic model as such:

1. Dogecoin user creates a cross-chain send to Ethereum in Dogecoin Core. To do this they must have an Ethereum client, and the two clients configured to communicate (RPC or otherwise).
2. Dogecoin Core creates a transaction with an output containing the coins to freeze, and a script with OP_SIDECHAINPROOFVERIFY, the Ethereum chain ID (we'll invent that later) locking the coins, and a public key hash or other secure identifier for the recipient, then relays it. Multiple outputs can be included, as well as standard change outputs if needed.
3. Freeze transaction is mined.
4. Dogecoin Core creates a corresponding Ethereum transaction to generate DOGE funds, and provides the freeze transaction's details as an input to show funds have been frozen. It relays this to the Ethereum network via the connected client.
5. Generate transaction is mined and the user now has control of the DOGE on the Ethereum chain.
[time passes]
6. User wants to move some DOGE back to the main chain. They create a burn transaction (means to be determined) for the DOGE on the Ethereum chain, which includes the public key hash of a private key they hold. They relay this transaction.
7. Burn transaction is mined.
8. User creates a thaw transaction paying themselves from the frozen Dogecoins on the Dogecoin chain (any of them? Probably, but we should have a good way to avoid too many colliding transactions), providing transaction ID of the burn transaction and a signature from the private key matching the public key in stage 6. They relay this transaction.
9. The network sees the thaw transaction, checks the specified transaction on the Ethereum chain burns at least as many coins as the thaw specifies, has not been used to thaw another transaction already (double-spend), and the signature is from the correct private key. It then accepts the transaction which is mined as normal.

Considerations:

* Apart from chain ID and public key (hash) to pay, does the freeze need any other inputs?
* How do we standardize the burn on the Ethereum chain, is there an OP_RETURN equivalent we can use neatly for this?
* How do we efficiently track these burnt transactions on the Ethereum chain. Are they considered UTXO until used in a thaw?
* How do we handle choosing coins to thaw on the main chain, so chances of colliding transactions are minimised?
* How do we motivate miners to mine these transactions? I'm presuming we have Dogecoin Core not mine these transactions unless it has an attached Ethereum client, which is then basically safe enough for any who don't want to get involved. Beyond that I suggest these transactions have very high fees (1kDOGE+, or about 1 USD) to make it actually worthwhile the miners bothering. I know that won't be hugely popular, but it's going to be a difficult case to make otherwise.

Elements sidechains uses op-codes up to OP_NOP_5 (https://github.com/ElementsProject/elements/blob/alpha/src/script/script.h#L172), so I'm looking at OP_NOP_6 for OP_SIDECHAINPROOFVERIFY, but if there's a reason that wouldn't be appropriate please let me know.

Okay, let me know why that won't work / what I've misunderstood!

After storing, I got really busy and could not pay much attention to the wallet. For safety, I protected the wallet with a password. I then made a backup of the wallet, to keep in a separate drive. 

&#x200B;

Some time after, I changed the hard drive (HD) on my computer (kept the old one just in case I needed it). However, when I tried to access the old HD this year, I was unable to access it. My guess, the drive got corrupted, and since the OS was encrypted, I don't think that the regular recovery software would work (please correct me if any of you know any software tools for recovering an SSD, with Ubuntu hard drive/OS encryption, that got corrupted). 

So I tried using the backup I created before changing the HD on my computer, but now I face another issue. Apparently, when I made the backups, since I was still starting with crypto, I did not manually export the keys. HOWEVER, it seems that MultiDoge did an automatic backup of the keys to the ""multidoge-data/key-backup/"" directory, which got copied with my wallet backup. However, this key must be either encrypted or encoded in some way, because the format is not the correct format for a doge wallet key. I tried to import this key when I tried to restore the MultiDoge wallet on my new SSD, but the client is not recognizing my password. 

&#x200B;

Does anyone here know how the original wallet key can be recovered from this backup key file?

Does anyone know where in the source code is the key backup generated or where the multidoge-data directory get updated? I tried looking through the source code but couldn't find this.

0.08,0.77,0.149,0.9681,"Before I get into this; this is a discussion thread. No decision has been made, and if the idea is rejected here it's unlikely to progress further.

As you'll have seen in the news, GHash recently achieved 51% of Bitcoin hashrate. I've said before we need to move to p2pool as a priority for all PoW coins, and this emphasises that need. However... p2pool adoption is making exceedingly slow progress. Proof of stake has been raised as a possibility a number of times before, and now seems a good time to re-open that discussion.

This would likely target the 1.8 client release, but for switchover in the 600k OR LATER blocks. Personally I would favour switchover around 1 million block; that's mid-2015. The intent there is to ensure miners who have bought hardware now have a reasonable chance to recoup costs, as well as give us a window in which to change course again if the situation changes (i.e. p2pool adoption skyrockets).

Advantages of proof of stake:

* Does not require significant processing power to maintain security of the block chain
* Reduced environmental impact (power consumption)

Disadvantages to proof of stake:

* Realistically, this hands responsibility for coin security to the very large wallet holders (exchanges and the like)
* Risk of encouraging hoarding of coins (can be mitigated through inflation)
* Encourages coins to be kept online (not in paper wallets) and therefore has security implications

You can read more on PoS at https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Proof_of_Stake - there are variants, but consider this a general discussion on the topic, and we'll discuss switchover blocks and other details if the idea is considered generally positive."

In 2014, I  acquired dogecoin for around 2 months through various transactions on  ebay and other means. Up until last week, that laptop sat on a shelf  with a dead battery and no internet connection whatsoever.

At  the beginning of this month, I downloaded a new 64 bit wallet, overwrote the wallet.dat file and allowed the wallet to update and  download the blockchain.

As it  finished this morning, I realized that on 5/6/2021, a -50,000  transaction had occurred WITHOUT any knowledge whatsoever on my part. My  old and new wallets show as being fully locked and no passphrases were  EVER given out, printed or ever looked at.

Looking  into more detail into this ""transaction"", it is CLEAR someone STOLE my  coins by tracking down an older transaction and redirecting it into  THEIR wallet. This is the address of the thief:    DGoBxd82tyyhPBbd1qcmAdqJVsWyANnNsQ

How  can something like this happen? I can prove the 50k transaction I  originally made because the addresses are clearly in the blockchain.

Here is the specific transaction of my STOLEN coins: [https://dogechain.info/tx/759bb9e9ea8cc7d13053fa5376555150cd899f850d07124853d67d9717349857](https://dogechain.info/tx/759bb9e9ea8cc7d13053fa5376555150cd899f850d07124853d67d9717349857)

The address the coins were taken from is a random RECEIVING address I gave the guy who I bought the coins from.. How is this possible?

Now, unless I'm a complete idiot and messed up severely - This is a very serious matter and a very serious breach of security. I would love some feedback on this from someone smarter than me.

Should a NEW doge wallet be updated (blockchain) BEFORE copying an old wallet.dat file over? 

UPDATE on the wallet - I downloaded the wallet on 5/10/2021 so this happened BEFORE I had any kind of wallet online. So they stole the coins right of the blockchain??

That said, it would not be difficult to add an optional window that could could allow a doge price on exchanges to be shown. When no one is exchanging fiat some day, totally could see this feature being deprecated. We could even even have a box that says, ""This feature is not part of the Dogecoin Core main functionality and requires queries against a third party system. If any features of this third party system are erroneous, the values may be distorted. You agree that this feature is for convenience and used at your own risk."" or something like that. It just seems like it would be nice to see values from your core wallet against your local currency -- at least until it takes over those currencies."

Even though Aither is a pre-launch startup, that doesn‚Äôt mean we‚Äôre unable to give to the community and I want our first public act to be one of giving and a gesture of goodwill. Dogecoin has massive fervor behind it; however, user adoption is a problem. That‚Äôs why today i‚Äôm proud to announce the alpha release and ongoing development of a Helm Chart and Docker images for running a Dogecoin FullNode on Kubernetes. It's rough and early, but I felt it more important to get this out to the world for collaboration opportunities instead of trying to deliver something overly polished 2 months from now. This will help standardization and make it easier to run Dogecoin in a server environment, develop for it, mine coins, and help secure the network. Most importantly, it‚Äôs a step in the right direction for reducing the barrier of entry into crypto. Using this vehicle, we can:

* Make it easier for anyone to run and operate Dogecoin FullNodes
* Enhance developer experience and tap into the massive Kubernetes ecosystem
* Lower the barrier of entry into crypto for education and for make benefit glorious community projects of Doge!
* Use it as a starting point for a Community Dogecoin DevOps program

Higher rewards for transactions are more appealing  for the miner, i understand.

But what if dogecoin transactions would have a priority system?

As it is the coin of  people, priorities should be done counting transactions of a wallet per day. if it is the first transaction (such send or much receive) of a wallet its prio 1, second is prio 2 etc.  like a normal consumer has like 30 Transactions per day . So we could reset the priorisation iterator  with the rise of the moon (nightfall). or maybe you can set it to whatever (24+) time you want... to seperate your transactions ""in the middle"".

the assigned priority could be increased per time.

With this we would solve a part of the fan in / fan out problem don't we?

0.024,0.843,0.134,0.9976,"# 1. Introduction

I keep seeing people coming back to the community and trying to restore or recover their wallets. Most of them already have the wallet.dat file and it's easy job for them usually. Nonetheless, there are many Shibas out there that have seedphrases, private keys, passwords or many other forms because they used Exodus Wallet or some online wallets, paper wallets etc.

I've been through a lot of research and work spent on restoring my wallet on Dogecoin Core. Now I'm sure for many it won't be most suitable or comfortable to do that, since the blockchain of main wallet takes about 70GB of space and tons of time to sync for the first time. Information found here can be still very helpful for you regardless. It might help you restore your wallet in other software as well.

# 2. Getting your Dogecoin Core up to date & sync'ed

That's a pretty difficult one so I will keep it short and point your way to another post that describes it in-depth.

1. Make sure you have the latest version of Dogecoin Core (1.14.3 at the time of writing it)
2. Download recent bootstrap of Dogecoin blockchain to speed up the process (more below)
3. Check wallet connections settings (Settings -> Options -> Network)
4. You can try adding nodes manually through debug console (more below)

So without making this too long, most of the stuff how to do these things and where to download bootstrap from April 2021 you can find already here:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/ms82cn/dogecoin\_blockchain\_20210416/](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/ms82cn/dogecoin_blockchain_20210416/)

# 3. Getting your private key

So most of you probably know that you can't really recover your wallets directly using seedphrase, like it works for many other cryptos. Although some websites with online wallets offer these options and so does Exodus (multi-wallet). Now, you don't need to use them to recover your wallet, just saying that this is where many of them come from and it's safer to not try recovering it online unless that's the original place where you created your wallet. I actually tried recovering mine on [dogechain.info](https://dogechain.info) \- that's probably the only online one I would trust but for some reason my recovery there failed with error, couldn't verify if I have 2FA enabled or something like that. I tried several times and neither worked.

Now, no matter what your seed is (12 word, 15 word, 24 or whatever you used/have), you can convert them to your private key, so exactly what all of them represent, it's just much more convenient to write down words instead of long string of numbers and letters. Now to do that, you can use different tools but most trusted and best I've seen was by iancolman:

[https://github.com/iancoleman/bip39/releases](https://github.com/iancoleman/bip39/releases)

1. Download the latest *bip39-standalone.html*
2. Turn off your internet connection (for extra safety)
3. Open the file you downloaded, change setting to Dogecoin
4. Write there your seedphrase

If you've done everything correctly, scroll down and you will see a list of addresses, paths, public and private keys. All of them belong to your seedphrase technically. Now, most of the time your wallet will be the top one. You can check the addresses and their balances on some dogecoin blockchain explorer just to make sure you're not wasting your time trying to recover empty wallet. Private key is what you need to recover it, that's the most important element and make sure to not share it with anyone and always keep it safe.

# 4. Recovering wallet

This one is pretty easy but not very intuitive if you were to guess or try alone doing it. If your Dogecoin Core if fully sync'ed and running, do this in order:

1. Help -> Debug Window -> Console
2. write command:  
`importprivkey <insert your private key here>`
3. Click enter. It will take some time to verify that (For me it took about 1h).

If your wallet is encrypted please unlock it first:

`walletpassphrase <your password> 500`

# 5. Final comments

If you're lucky and everything was done accordingly, you've just recovered your wallet! It worked for me and I'm sharing this in hope that it works for you too. If you still require further help or have questions, feel free to ask in comments. If this was a helpful solution for you and you want to tip me some doge, send me a private message and I will share my wallet address (every doge counts!)"
0.044,0.922,0.034,-0.5204,"Hey all. I was just adding dogecoin donations over at PortableApps.com and I noticed that I can't use dogecoin:address style links for the dogecoin address as I can with bitcoin and litecoin. The bitcoin: and litecoin: protocols are registered with Windows as you install the bitcoin and litecoin clients respectively. But dogecoin is just a zip download on Windows which makes it a bit harder for the non-technical to install and means that it can't register the protocol as it's installing.

As I've worked with installer tech for nearly a decade now, I was wondering if you guys would like a proper Windows installer for dogecoin?

0.02,0.85,0.13,0.9893,"Yo shibes,

I wanted to cover a bundle of things going on, so people know where development efforts are currently focused:

* A number of improvements have been proposed and are targeted for release with 1.14.3:
  * Additional DNS seeds have been added, to provide improved robustness when discovering initial nodes.
  * Improved mempool handling by reducing the default expiry time from 14 days to 1 day which will reduce waiting time for locked-in transactions due to insufficient fee.
  * UI for creating 2-of-3 and 2-of-2 multisig transactions - pending testing and final review.  
* We are working on making syncing faster, having identified two issues with 1.14.2:
  * There‚Äôs expensive validation done on every block loaded from disk, so every time a remote node requests a block or header, there‚Äôs a CPU cost before it‚Äôs sent over the network. Fixing this improves performance by about 3-5 times.
  * The nodes overly aggressively timeout remote nodes if they don‚Äôt receive blocks fast enough, which means during high load they‚Äôre more likely to disconnect nodes they could (slowly, but progressively) be downloading from.
* We are currently reviewing fixes for the above two issues and hopefully will release 1.14.3 once they‚Äôre verified safe:
  * https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin/pull/1676
  * https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin/pull/1705
* Dogecoin Core 1.18 (based on Bitcoin Core 0.18) work has begun, but we‚Äôre fundamentally rethinking how we adapt Bitcoin to Dogecoin. This will improve later update pace, but it‚Äôs not going to happen overnight.
  * The main thing is rather than trying to jump from Bitcoin to Dogecoin in one big leap, we‚Äôre now updating one small thing, fixing all the tests, then continuing. You can see this sort of progress in https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin/pull/1686
* A roadmap for 1.18, along with details of which protocol updates we would propose for activation, are coming soon.
* The Android wallet has a number of improvements coming:
  * New checkpoints to improve sync time, especially for new wallets.
  * Updated to the latest bitcoinj library as well as introducing improvements from the corresponding Bitcoin Wallet release (dark mode!)

Over the past months I have answered across reddit and across Twitter several requests, and I tried to rectify a lot of misinformation. If you have read any of these interactions, I tend to hammer in the idea that Dogecoin has always had a stable and capable development team.

Many people come to this community after having read a couple of articles on major  outlets (CNN's recent one comes to mind, but they are all the same on this topic) where it is always, invariably stated that Dogecoin has no fundamentals, has no use cases, and all the developers have left in 2015. This is certainly a fault on the lack of research of the writer, but as they say, that cat is out of the bag, and it is up to us to fix this misunderstanding. I am the first to get a bit angry when I see these comments, but then I realize the fault is also on our end.

I would thus propose the following:

1. **As a shibe, if you see people spreading this misinformation about the reality of Dogecoin development, please take the time to write a reply explaining how things really stand. Be polite.** People might be lazy and not do proper research, but we cannot act in the same rude way in which other cryptocommunities used to answer to newcomers. So, please answer these misconceptions about the developers whenever you see them on Twitter, on Reddit, on Facebook, or when your favorite YouTuber or journalist perpetuates the mistake.
2. **Would it make sense to update the website to include a small page about the development team of Doge?** Could anyone of the current development team write a statement , discussed before publishing with all current developers, explaining how dogecoin was maintained tirelessly all these years to work as a currency and which we could then share as a reliable source on wikipedia and media? 
3. **Social media: would it make sense to write more frequent updates on the developers' Twitter channel detailing what is being worked on?** Even a couple of updates per week just saying what is going on, to show the work being done, explaining what some of the stuff being done is. I would volunteer to do it, but I have been a lurker for years in this community, I am not a blockchain developer (just a regular web dev), and I would not trust a person with no credentials like me to do it. But anybody that can listen in on the discussions between the developers and write a small report every once in a while could do it?
4. **Underline in all communications that Dogecoin is a grassroots operation, so anybody with the right skills can join the project.** Fork the project on github, follow the discussions, and get coding. Or contribute to an external API, such as the Rosetta API.

Please add to this thread and start helping with this now!"

I wanted to reach out and see if you could shed some light on the developments needed to allow for dogecoin to be listed on coinbase and if that is truly what is preventing it to be listed?

I am a total tech noob and don‚Äôt even know what that really means, but wanted to see if you could provide clarity straight from the source. One, what is Rosetta API and what does it do for dogecoin? Two, is there development needed to list on coinbase or have they just simply not picked it up yet?

Perhaps Dogecoin could adopt that, or a similar multi-PoW system but with fewer algorithms. 

It occurs to me that we have a huge number of casual users who would be willing to CPU mine, and may not care that much if they are mining at a loss so long as they see some coins. Then we will get a lot of gamers from /u/mohland's move into twitch.tv, and they may be inclined to GPU mine. As several people have noted probably mom and dad is paying for the electricity, so they also may not mind to mine at a mild loss, especially because they will get some free tacocoin thanks to their decision to merge mine with us.

As you also likely know, I spend a lot of time attempting to reunite lapsed Shibes with their now life-changing amounts of Doge. There are established recovery paths for most situations, and generally a little reading or simple questions are sufficient.

However, Dough has always been a huge pain in various parts of the anatomy. As a non-standard HD client, the usual repertoire of Bitcoin recovery tools don‚Äôt work, and when it was abandoned, the author posted a recovery tool on the website.

Unfortunately, this tool is patchy at best. Some people have had success. Some have fiddled with the offsets to find the child wallet they needed. Many others however have ended up with lists of thousands of wallets, all empty. And some have simply given up and abandoned their coins.

This has stumped even seasoned programmers (I don‚Äôt count myself among them, my coding days are a dim and distant memory from several lives ago).

As I see it, there are a few issues to address.

* What exactly are the deviations from BIP32?
* Is the seed phrase BIP39-compliant?
* Does the derivation path follow the standard?
* Can used children be identified reliably?
* Are there reliable ways to use existing tools?

And as a community, we must accept some responsibility for the situation. The client was listed as the official iOS client for a long time before being removed from the website.

0.026,0.837,0.136,0.9867,"Hi all,

Just a quick in-between update on what I'm up to. This weekend has primarily been spent on the libraries [bitcoin-ruby](https://github.com/lian/bitcoin-ruby) and [python-bitcoinlib](https://github.com/petertodd/python-bitcoinlib), adding unit tests to bitcoin-ruby and pushing forward with Dogecoin support for python-bitcoinlib via the wrapper [python-altcoinlib](https://github.com/rnicoll/python-altcoinlib)

I've also been compiling Dogecoin Core 1.8.2 for release, which means doing Gitian (deterministic) builds. Dogecoin Core 1.8.2 is based on the new OpenSSL 1.0.1l. This isn't a required update, it's primarily just for anyone installing a new copy, as the bugfixes shouldn't affect Dogecoin Core, but it's good practice to keep up to date.

I'm currently spending time on libraries as a first step in improving the tools for developers wishing to work with Dogecoin. Python-bitcoinlib wraps around the reference client (Dogecoin Core) and provides an easier to use interface to the RPC calls, for example parsing blocks and transactions before they're returned to the calling system. bitcoin-ruby is more designed as a stand-alone implementation of blockchain technology, and is used by the Toshi client software.

Longer term, I want to try further simplifying the steps involved in getting started coding with Dogecoin, both by providing more in-depth examples, and also through making the API harder to mis-use. Even as-is, though, we're one of the best supported altcoins in terms of alternative implementations (covering Java, JS, Python and Ruby at least).

Lastly, Cate main net tests have missed this weekend; unfortunately having based it on python-altcoinlib, there's changes I need in python-bitcoinlib to make everything fit together. Running a customised version locally is fine, but for getting others to help testing I really want it more working straight out of the box. I have however written more unit tests for Cate to improve code checks generally.

This is related to this post I've previously sent:

http://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoindev/comments/1v9atv/regarding_a_facebook_tipping_app/

**THE ACTION**

I've been struggling with Facebook during the past days, and I've finally came up with something.
It is overwhelmingly incomplete -I'm working on the core at the moment- but it's gonna be ready
within a couple of days.

Now, Facebook's API isn't friendly. As far as I've seen, /u/dogetipbot receives notifications
when it is mentioned anywhere on Reddit. That can't be achieved on Facebook unless you have
the user (bot) added as friend, and there is no automatic way to authorize those requests.

So I came up with two options: the app's page and a group page.

**TIPPING OVER THE BOT'S PAGE**

Anyone can post to an app's page if permitted, so it isn't a problem there. You can post


    Give 100 doges to @someone

And the bot -constantly reading the page's stream- can parse that, get the id of the tagged user and send the funds to him.

But you can't simply share something with the page... unless it is a group. So I've created an open group. 

**TIPPING OVER AN OPEN GROUP**

So you subscribe to the group. So you share something with the group. Everything works fine if:

* You post a simple message as the one above.
* You share with the group a photo, a video or a post. Only those things -not links- can be tracked back to its author.

The f*cking problem with the group is that you have to be authorized by someone -even when it is open- to start sharing there things worth tipping.

**THE WHOLE BURRITO**

The platform has three layers:

1. **The Facebook part:** If you are a Facebook dev, you can use the code to make your own bot and offer it for your app's users. But you need to *connect* to a tipping service provider (the middle level).

2. **The tipping service provider:** If you have a web server, you can use the code to be used as a gateway to not only Facebook tipping bots, but to other ""engines"" (Wordpress, Joomla, etc.). But you'll need to connect to a Dogecoin Daemon API provider (the lower level).

3. **Dogecoin Daemon API provider:** this is an extremely secured host whose network name or address isn't publicly available. Only for your clients (the middle level).

**WHY SO COMPLEX?**

For two reasons:

1. Security: the first layer (""The client"") is no target for attackers. The second one (""The provider"") can be target of attacks, because it may serve to several clients. But the third layer (""The daemon"") is the most secure, because it has the wallet.

2. Business opportunity: You can set all layers on a single host and assume all the risk if you want. Then charge for withdrawing funds from the accounts (as most providers do). But if you decide to host the second and third layers, you can get the fees for yourself or, kindly enough, give a revenue share to the first layer.

I'll explain all this further. I first need to get the core finished so it is tested and then, finished and released for everyone.

I'll be posting an update here for if everyone wants to help testing :)"

So, in Bit, Lite, Doge (pre-AuxPoW) etc, blocks are indexed in LevelDB. Each block has a ""key"" which identifies it, and is in the format:

    'b' <block hash>

So far, so simple. In United Scrypt Coin, which is the coin we merged AuxPoW code from, it has two different types of entries for blocks, the main block, and then any AuxPoW data. They're stored with keys such as:

    'b' <block hash> 'a'
    'b' <block hash> 'b'

So, we had three basic options:

1. Totally redesign how AuxPoW is stored on disk in a highly limited timescale.
2. Cobble together a solution to understand that 'b' <block hash>  is equivalent to 'b' <block hash> 'a' and a missing AuxPoW section is fine
3. Reindex and fix the problem once as a migration issue.

I did make a serious stab at the second option, and basically it came down to risk of creating subtle problems later by having weird hybrid data formats, vs fixing it properly. We've gone for the third option, and while I'm aware it's tedious, hopefully you'll understand longer term it's the safer bet.

Karma replaced by Dogecoin, Dogeium model gives each user 50 DOGE when signing up. Free to buy more/acquire more. 1 vote = 1 DOGE, price varies

Each user given a ""Spaceship"" that they can decorate, post their own articles, content, etc. Gather followers, capped at 250 before costs DOGE. Can buy decorations/tools for DOGE.

Space Stations are hubs for users, can subscribe and get articles/links/content related to topics. Like a twitter feed. 5 DOGE to ""dock"" at a space station. 

Moons are niche topic sub-reddits, less moderation. <---Can buy

Planets are larger, moderated sub-reddits (/r/dogecoin). <---Can buy

Solar Systems contain many planets (gaming, truegaming, pokemon, retrogaming) <---Must own several planets to buy

Galaxies (Sports, Football, soccer, mma, squaredcircle, etc) <---Must own several systems to buy

Universes (books, funny, movies, tv, politics, science, etc) <---Must own several galaxies to buy

Moons and planets can set their own DOGE price to post, comment, vote, etc. 

Larger systems and galaxies will adhere to standard pricing.

Users give away their Karma with each vote and can acquire more by getting votes or buying more.

Users can tip additional Karma aside from 1 vote.

Users can associate with charity and donate portion of their upvotes/Doge.

Users can ""cash out"" and delete their account and donate all of their Doge to charity.

0.05,0.809,0.141,0.9891,"Some view new addition of Dogecoin 5 billion per year as a weakness, generally they are looking for a quick profit. Some of us view it as a strength, [elon musk did](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1358648653573992450), the reason I think is that this will enable more people to adopt the currency and stabilize the value and providing a good source of liquidity. Basically if your goal is to become global currency, you have to take into account the population growth and to enable the new generation not yet born to create wealth. Imagine a future  nightmare scenario if the majority of global wealth are measured by capped crypto that's held by an aging population, we will effectively has young population enslaved by aging crypto hoarder. Constant supply of Dogecoin will hopefully avoid those outcome. Regardless of the energy usage of mining, I think proof of work is still the best way to guard value, because it rewards effort, not wealth. 

This got us to the problem of how to effectively grow Dogecoin to all the 7.7 billion human on earth. Ultimately the goal should be to enable all human to transact and use Dogecoin as a medium of exchange let say on average human do 2 transaction per day, that's 15.4 billion /day or 178000 transaction/second. Majority of it can be offloaded outside the blockchain, but I think it is still important for every single individual of the 7.7 billion human to have their own address in the main blockchain, otherwise it's not really fair for the late adopter and eventual new generation. How much transaction speed we need in the main blockchain? lets say on average people move their asset in the main blockchain once per month, then we need 7.7billion/(3600x24x30)= 2970/second, again elon musk think so . Now for someone more knowing, is this value possible to be adopted to the main network? after all its only 100x current throughput, knowing the growth in the storage and computing.

In the world of capped crypto designed to enrich the early adopter, i think Dogecoin has set itself apart and embracing actual usage. Computer, transport, phone, almost every technology is factually better for the late adopter. Current situation in crypto is mostly the reverse, people's fear of missing out drives the adoption and its generally worse for the late adopter. I can't imagine the disaster and social unrest if majority of the global wealth is held not because of effort, but because early adopter effect(smart though it may be).

Finally, thanks for all the genuine loyal Dogecoin supporter that has to go through thick and thin. Dogecoin is the [underdoge](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1360007611781795840) and should stop underestimating itself."

0.028,0.894,0.079,0.9743,"Almost everyone in this community wants to  see Dogecoin successful. However, I keep seeing posts asking for formal organization of Dogecoin or people asking the developers to make changes to Dogecoin (without realizing the negative implications those changes could have) - all in response to Elon Musks tweet. 

Asking the developers questions is fine (I ask them questions all the time) but please stop and think before making a post or reaching out to them. 

Here a few points to consider:

A) Elon musk is not saying that Dogecoin SHOULD have formal organization. He‚Äôs saying it DOESNT have it. That‚Äôs a good thing. 

B) asking for formal organization doesn‚Äôt make sense and counter productive to the point of Cryptocurrency. Cryptocurrency is founded upon decentralized control. Always has been. The control is in the people in the community. Not one person. 

C) Dogecoin is open source. Anyone can work on Dogecoin development if they know how to code and know what they are doing. 

D) The development team has always been working on Dogecoin. Even before Elon Musk. They will continue to do so with or without him. People are only asking about it now because Elon brought it to everyone‚Äôs attention, but the development team has always been very helpful and responding to the community. Just please. Do your research before bringing up a point because odds are - it‚Äôs already been address 1,000 times.

Common things people ask the development team (devs are welcome to reply and clarify any thing if it‚Äôs incorrect) 

1. create a burning system to reduce the supply - already been answered. Not happening. Burning is counter productive anyway. If you want to burn your coins you already can send your coins to a burn address. Stop asking to burn or reduce the supplies of OTHER peoples coins. Not happening 

2. Create a supply cap. Not happening - already been answered. Dogecoin already has a supply cap of 10,000 coins per minute  which turns into 4% yearly inflation rate which is negligible. Having a cap does nothing in terms of the actual value of Dogecoin or bitcoin or practically any other cryptocurrency for that matter at the current moment. The cap only matters once that limit has been reached. The cap for bitcoin doesn‚Äôt happen until 2140. At no point in dogecoins existence has inflation been an issue. Demand is and will continue to be orders higher than any inflation rate. The supply and inflation has already been proven over and over to be a non-issue

3. Transaction speeds and transaction fees. They‚Äôre Working on it - have been for months before Elon‚Äôs tweet

4. Coinbase integration - working on it - have been for months.

5. Anything else - check their GitHub or r/Dogecoindev. They‚Äôve been working on Dogecoin for 8 years. Odds are your question has been answered. If your question hasn‚Äôt been answered THEN consider making a post.

0.049,0.856,0.095,0.9086,"This is not for the core developers at all. It's not a suggestion or request of anybody.

I was just thinking about how there are two potential use cases for doge - cheaper online transactions, and also travelers who might want to be able to exchange money with each other, or buy things without needing local currency, or being at risk of being robbed (or have currency conversion fees for that matter).

Those conversion and processor fees seriously sting.

Each of these use cases almost needs a software solution. An out of the box, pre-made payment system for direct shopping orders with doge, not through fiat or a third party. And preferably something compatible directly with a popular merchant platform. If someone developed this, a one off fee could be charged, generating profits, without needing to charge for transactions. 

And a way to obtain doge, without needing an exchange, or having an entry barrier. People have reported finding this complicated, having delays to get approved, or just generally not finding it easy enough.   


Perhaps something like dogecoin dex can be that? I'm not sure. But it needs to be easier for folk to get crypto. Regulation has made it complicated. It should be as easy as getting a gift card. 

If were somehow much easier to GET doge, I think that would make it more appealing to those use cases.

Just floating these ideas, for discussion."
0.077,0.771,0.152,0.9369,"I can't recall seeing much discussion about setting transaction fees based on the age of the outputs being spent. I'm starting to think it could be a great solution that balances reasonable fees while still prevents spam transactions.

I'm imagining tx fee schedule based on the number of confirmations of outputs being spent. It might look something like this:

1 doge <1000 conf  >0.1 doge <10,000 conf > 0.01 doge <100,000 conf

This has benefits of reducing spam since you'd need to hold coins several months before low fees kick in. It places a higher fee burden on high frequency spenders/traders. And it rewards casual users since older outputs are charged the lowest fees.

Since dogecoin has BIP068 enabled, implementing this might even be provided through a checksequenceverify script. This has the added economic encouragement for wallet developers to integrate more advanced scripting capabilities to dogecoin wallets.

I'd love to hear if anyone has given this serious thought. Any other projects out there that may have already experimented with this? Any detailed technical examples of C functions that check input priority based on confirmations?"

https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin/pull/1405 is the current state of disabling SegWit in Dogecoin 1.14, which as a side-effect seems to ""resolve"" an issue with peer to peer comms between 1.14 and other clients. There's two things I'd like people to consider here:

1. Please check for anything else I need to do to ensure SegWit is properly disabled, and let me know if I've missed anything.
2. Without this patch, 1.14 rejects connections from a lot of clients because they don't advertise the SegWit service... which is sort of nuts, frankly. Having a work-around is great, but this patch probably shouldn't fix this either. If someone has time to dig further into this it would be greatly appreciated; start by identifying which clients are being rejected (I think it's 1.10, but haven't checked), then please look into whether we're overly aggressively expecting services, or if P2P protocol version numbers are incorrect, or something else.

0.034,0.875,0.091,0.9577,"Dear Dogecoin Developers community,

I am interested in designing a small attachable device to existing payment terminals that will accept DOGE as a payment through NFC on your mobile devices. However, I would like to discuss in details about why? what? how?

&#x200B;

\*Why?\*

With this cryptocurrency transformation going nowadays, more and more online stores are accepting cryptocurrency as a form of payment. The real stores, however, are having hard times. The payment process includes various complicated details such as: setting up the crypto wallet, requesting the payment, navigating through application after scanning the QR code, and many other manual steps that can be automated. For us, in the tech-savvy world, these processes may be neglected, but not for the people that value the time and subconsciously embrace the simplicity. Moreover, the payment cannot be proceeded through NFC, i.e. a way of making it contactless.

&#x200B;

\*What?\*

In the existing market, the major payment manufacturers are VeriFone, Ingenico, CPI, and few more. What I am suggesting is inventing a small payment device that can be either attached to these payment machines, or operate on its own with only one goal of accept cryptocurrencies as a form of payment. The device should be pretty compact, with the size of the USB flash drive(better to be discussed later). Now, once it is connected to the main computer inside the stores, it will:

\-automatically create the wallet for the store owner

\-navigate with the ""cash"" register, so that once the cashier proceeds to the payment stage, the request of ABC Doge will be sent to our device and the customer will use their phone.

This definitely means that the customer needs to have an app that will work with our device.

&#x200B;

\*How?\*

I have experience working with CAD (multiple projects, scientific researches, etc)

Before starting the Product design part, I would like to ask the community of the developers, what else do I need to include within this device. I know the project sounds ""Impossible"", but why not give it a try?

&#x200B;

I am open to any comments and suggestions."
0.086,0.784,0.13,0.9691,"Yesterday I posted [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/1zl4w7/why_i_think_dogecoin_will_collapse_in_january_2015/) thread about a concern that I have once we reach block 600,001 and the block reward goes to 10k.

My concern, based on using the mining profitability calculator on coinwarz.com is that once the block reward goes to 10k at block 600,001 the price of Doge has to be above $0.01 for mining to remain profitable (electrical bill & recouping hardware cost).  The $0.01 is the minimum.  Now Dogecoin could most certainly go up beyond that and I believe that it might.  But what if it doesn't?  We could have miners bailing out onto other more profitable coins.  

Based on the calculator, it appears that if the price remains where it is now and the block reward goes to 10k, the hash rate has to drop to a little below 140 (approx. 1100 now) for Dogecoin to be profitable again (barely).  So what happens when our hash rate falls to 140.  According to BillyM2K 
> BillyM2kDogecoin co-founder
It wouldn't be ideal and having a low hash rate reduces the ""price"" that it would cost to attack the coin. Thus the dogecoin community shouldn't be a bunch of dickheads to make people want to attack the coin and community.

So the potential solution that I raise is the possibility of ""merged mining "" for Dogecoin. I had PM'ed BillyM2K regarding that possibility and initially he indicated that it wouldn't be a good idea, but then clarified in my post yesterday that he initially misunderstood the question and that merged mining is not a bad idea for Dogecoin.
> BillyM2kDogecoin co-founder  
It's not a bad idea to be honest. I misunderstood the initial question when you asked.

Yesterday I inquired from him whether he thought that I should solicit the opinion of the community regarding this and he wisely stated that it might be better if I approached the Dev community instead, since you guys/gals understand the nuances of such an endeavor, whereas the community at large might not.

So here is my question: would merge mining be a good thing to protect Dogecoin in the very near future.  I don't think that any other coin is going to face the hurdle that we're about to face in January 2015.  We can all hope that Dogecoin is at or well above $0.01 per Doge, but what if it isn't? Miners will not mine at a loss.  Could we tweak Dogecoin to make it merge mine-able with Litecoin. This way miners can mine Litecoin as a primary coin and use the same hash to mine Dogecoin simultaneously.

I believe that merged mining, for now, can only be done on a P2P pool and there are only 2 of them up and running right now.  

Please share your thoughts on whether this is a good idea or not.

0.047,0.91,0.043,-0.3632,"I have a question about Dogecoin. Lets say that the crypto market in the following years grows exponentialy and BTC reaches $1m or more. Lets also assumes dogecoin will be one of the coins that will survive and  reaches a crazy value of 8$, 10$ or more.  Wouldn't 1√ê=1√ê makes the doge fees huge then for day to day simple use?  For example if 1√ê=10$ and i buy a cup of coffee with doge which costs 3$, wouldnt that mean i will actualy spent 13$ for it? Or buy something that costs 10$, i will pay double that ammount in doge. Of course buying expensive staff wont really make a big diference compared to what we have now.

If things move in the faster tx direction it would seem that having a lot of nodes at the chain tip would be super important. Worth incentivizing? 

I am thinking about the PoW energy paradox...I understand the criticism to PoS centralization so instead of rewarding as a function of coin balance, why not reward nodes which are fully synced? This will become increasingly difficult and increasingly important. This would incentivize many many more shibes to run good nodes with quality connections and uptime. 

What are the weaknesses here? A bad actor would have to run a buncha nodes to cause trouble ya, but I suppose they wouldn‚Äôt have to own any doge. But potentially many more honest people will be incentivized to do so too. Maybe some involvement of coin balance is necessary to ensure the attacker is disincentivized to successfully attack their own network.

I know this was discussed but i havent seen extensive reasoning -Please explain the logic, we have 145bil dogecoins with 5bil+entering circulation every year. 

That makes increasing doge value harder doesn‚Äôt it? Ethereum only reached 100mil not long ago and bitcoin is capped at 21mil.

Im not here to argue im not a pro just did basic research id love to get your take on this.

It seems like even now weve got too many coins to ever consider reaching 100$, which could be plausible in a few years with a popular deflating coin.
For 150bil coins to reach 1$=150bil market cap. Thats why 100$ seems unrealistic, it would take trillions, far more than bitcoin has in cap now. What am i missing?

If your answer is we don‚Äôt want to reach 100$ please explain why? If doge was a deflating coing instead if an inflating one would it not be possible?"
0.069,0.835,0.096,0.7443,"I'll get straight to the point.

I've been working on a Facebook ""tipping"" app too (it's actually just transferring the dogecoins from one account to another, not properly tipping), and I've ~~stumbled across a rather big block~~ smashed my face against a wall.

Take point I.13.c of the Facebook Platform Policy

>c. Games on Facebook.com or Mobile Web **must use Facebook Payments as their sole and exclusive payment method for all virtual goods and currencies made available to users within the game**. All other payment options are prohibited within games on Facebook.com or Mobile Web unless they go through Facebook Payments rather than directly through that payment option. By ‚ÄúPayment Method‚Äù we mean any method that allows a user to complete a transaction in a game that is on Facebook.com or Mobile Web, including, without limitation, by exchanging monetary value for virtual currency or virtual goods, whether directly at the time of purchase or via any previous transaction such as the user's earlier purchase of a prepaid gift card or electronic code. **In-game rewards of virtual currency or virtual goods earned by users through game-play activity alone are exempt from this definition**.

That basically says that for the currency to be available in the game it must either be purchased via Facebook Payment API (meaning you sell it) or via gameplay (a la dogec0in, you get 1 Dogecoin every X messages). Transferring it via deposit is most likely a circumvention of the rules and it's certainly not going to be welcomed by the Facebook team.

I've been trying to get an answer out of those asshats at Facebook for the last week but they basically told me to lawyer up while doing their best to avoid answering anything at all I asked them. It's the worst support I ever saw.

I refrained from releasing my app in order to avoid creating drama in case these apps get shut down. My thoughts go to people who have never heard about cryptocurrencies in their lives. If something happened to the app they will most likely lose access to their Dogecoins and think of a scam, burning them and scaring them off Doges and the like.

What are your thoughts on this whole deal? Am I obsessing over nothing? Should we just release everything and hope for the best?"

* The client app (which the final user goes over).

Right now, the tipping goes over the ""GiveDogesTo"" group. It's the only feed I could monitor with no issues.

In order to get started, you must authorize the app, then join the group and post your commands there (only tipping). The withdraw requests go over the app's dashboard.

Tipping commands are issued every minute. The app sends requests to join if you're tipping someone who isn't registered, and it sends tipping+balance notifications to recipients and senders when the transfer success.

**[Edit]** It is was registered as a game but that's no more :) ...at the end, it didn't loose functionality with the Graph API.

**Here be the links**

* https://apps.facebook.com/wpdogetipping/ - The app. Read before authorizing it.

0,1,0,0,What happened to that project?
0.05,0.887,0.063,0.2461,"Hello shibes.

As many of you have noticed, other cryptos' blockchain explorers often list, next to some of the top wallets, the name of the exchange holding that wallet. As an example, [https://bitinfocharts.com/top-100-richest-bitcoin-addresses.html](https://bitinfocharts.com/top-100-richest-bitcoin-addresses.html), [https://nanocharts.info/](https://nanocharts.info/), or [https://adaex.org/richlist](https://adaex.org/richlist).

Several times, on reddit and on twitter, I tried to fight against the FUD surrounding the ownership of the top Dogecoin wallets. Most of them are obviously exchange cold/hot wallets, as anybody who has been into crypto for more than a couple of months would be able to recognize.

Unfortunately, also due to the insistence in spreading misinformation of several media outlets and of guys like Hoskinson, people outside the Doge community  keep spreading the lie that Dogecoin is more unfairly distributed than other cryptos.

We have had users investigating and identifying owners of several top wallets in such a way that leaves little space to any doubt. This is the case of the DH5 wallet, for example: [https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/lkwnny/mystery\_solved\_the\_billionaire\_dogecoin\_whale\_aka/](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/lkwnny/mystery_solved_the_billionaire_dogecoin_whale_aka/). Users like u/Fulvio55 have also tracked some hot wallets back to Binance, according to his past posts.

Now, you might  say ours are just ""speculations"" (at least those concerning cold wallets, since hot wallets are easier to track unequivocally back to an exchange through withdrawals and deposits). But as a matter of fact, the ownership of the top wallets shown in bitinfocharts for Bitcoin or for nano in [https://nanocharts.info/](https://nanocharts.info/) (and so on for many other cryptocurrencies) comes from the same kind of speculation  that u/AndreiFromAlberta did in the DH5 thread linked above. **The difference is that for BTC, bitinfocharts has no problem listing that kind of speculation as fact, whereas for Dogecoin they are not doing the same.**

This is a problem for us, because whenever I try to make people understand some of the top wallets cannot be anything but cold/hot wallets for exchanges, I am pointed to lists such as [https://bitinfocharts.com/top-100-richest-bitcoin-addresses.html](https://bitinfocharts.com/top-100-richest-bitcoin-addresses.html), [https://nanocharts.info/](https://nanocharts.info/) as proof that Bitcoin is different in comparison with Doge, whereas the situation is substantially the same (with the added problem that Bitcoin had a substantial amount of coins mined by very few people).

Can we do a community push to collect information about all the top wallets and then ask the major Dogecoin explorers (bitinfocharts, [dogechain.com](https://dogechain.com) [sochain.com](https://sochain.com)) to list the identity of the wallet holders as it is being done for almost any other crypto?

So, we would need to first gather proof for each of the top 20-30 wallets, like Andrei did for the DH5 wallet, and then contact the Dogecoin blockchain explorers to add a note like they do for other exchanges next to each wallet."

## What Is A Full Node?

A full node is a program that fully validates transactions and blocks. Almost all full nodes also help the network by accepting transactions and blocks from other full nodes, validating those transactions and blocks, and then relaying them to further full nodes.

Most full nodes also serve lightweight clients by allowing them to transmit their transactions to the network and by notifying them when a transaction affects their wallet. If not enough nodes perform this function, clients won't be able to connect through the peer-to-peer network---they'll have to use centralized services instead.

Many people and organizations volunteer to run full nodes using spare computing and bandwidth resources---but more volunteers are needed to allow Dogecoin to continue to grow.  This document describes how you can help and what helping will cost you.

## Costs And Warnings

Running a Dogecoin full node comes with certain costs and can expose you to certain risks. This section will explain those costs and risks so you can decide whether you're able to help the network.

## Special Cases

Miners, businesses, and privacy-conscious users rely on particular behavior from the full nodes they use, so they will often run their own full nodes and take special safety precautions. This document does not cover those precautions---it only describes running a full node to help support the Dogecoin network in general.

## Secure Your Wallet

It's possible and safe to run a full node to support the network and use its wallet to store your Dogecoins, but you must take the same precautions you would when using any Dogecoin wallet.  Please see the [dogecoin core guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/wiki/dogecoincoreguide#wiki_safety_first.21_encrypting_your_wallet) for more information.

## Minimum Requirements

Dogecoin Core full nodes have certain requirements. If you try running a node on weak hardware, it may work---but you'll likely spend more time dealing with issues. If you can meet the following requirements, you'll have an easy-to-use node.

* Desktop or laptop hardware running recent versions of Windows, Mac OS X, or Linux.
* 50 gigabytes of free disk space, accessible at a minimum read/write speed of 100 MB/s.
* 2 gigabytes of memory (RAM)
* A broadband Internet connection with upload speeds of at least 400 kilobits (50 kilobytes) per second
* An unmetered connection, a connection with high upload limits, or a connection you regularly monitor to ensure it doesn't exceed its upload limits.
* 6 hours a day that your full node can be left running. (You can do other things with your computer while running a full node.) More hours would be better, and best of all would be if you can run your node continuously.

## Possible Problems

* Legal: Dogecoin use is prohibited or restricted in some areas.
* Bandwidth limits: Some Internet plans will charge an additional amount for any excess upload bandwidth used that isn't included in the plan. Worse, some providers may terminate your connection without warning because of overuse. We advise that you check whether your Internet connection is subjected to such limitations and monitor your bandwidth use so that you can stop Dogecoin Core before you reach your upload limit.
* Anti-virus: Several people have placed parts of known computer viruses in the Dogecoin block chain. This block chain data can't infect your computer, but some anti-virus programs quarantine the data anyway, making it more difficult to run Dogecoin Core. This problem mostly affects computers running Windows.
* Attack target: Dogecoin Core powers the Dogecoin peer-to-peer network, so people who want to disrupt the network may attack Dogecoin Core users in ways that will affect other things you do with your computer, such as an attack that limits your available download bandwidth.

## Initial Block Download (IBD)

Initial block download refers to the process where nodes synchronize themselves to the network by downloading blocks that are new to them. This will happen when a node is far behind the tip of the best block chain. In the process of IBD, a node does not accept incoming transactions nor request mempool transactions.

If you are trying to set up a new node following the instructions below, you will go through the IBD process at the first run, and it may take a considerable amount of time since a new node has to download the entire block chain (which is roughly 50 gigabytes now). During the download, there could be a high usage for the network and CPU (since the node has to verify the blocks downloaded), and the client will take up an increasing amount of storage space ([reduce storage](#reduce-storage) provides more details on reducing storage).

Before the node finishes IBD, you will not be able to see a new transaction related to your account until the client has caught up to the block containing that transaction. So your wallet may not count new payments/spendings into the balance.

If you are using Dogecoin Core GUI, you can monitor the progress of IBD in the status bar (left bottom corner).

## Linux Instructions

The following instructions describe installing Dogecoin Core using tools available in most mainstream Linux distributions.  We assume you use a Bourne-like shell such as `bash`.

Using any computer, go to the [Dogecoin Core download page](https://dogecoin.com/). Choose the appropriate file for your Linux install (either 32-bit or 64-bit) and download the file. If necessary, move the file to the computer you want to use to run Dogecoin Core.

If you aren't already logged into the computer you want to install Dogecoin on, login now.  Make sure you use an account that can use `su` or `sudo` to install software into directories owned by the root user.

If you logged in graphically, start a terminal.  If you logged in another way, we will assume you're already in a shell.

Locate the file you downloaded and extract it using the `tar` command followed by the argument `xzf` followed by the file name. The argument `xzf` means eXtract the gZipped tar archive File. For example, for a 64-bit tar archive in your current directory, the command is:

    tar xzf dogecoin-1.14.3-x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.gz

This will create the directory `dogecoin-1.14.3` within your current working directory. We will install the contents of its `bin` subdirectory into the `/usr/local/bin` directory using the the `install` command. The install command is part of the GNU coreutils available on nearly every Linux distribution, and the `/usr/local/bin` directory is a standard location for self-installed executables (you may edit the commands below to use a different location).

If you use `sudo` to run commands as root, use the following command line:

    sudo install -m 0755 -o root -g root -t /usr/local/bin dogecoin-1.14.3/bin/*

If you use `su` to run commands as root, use the following command line:

    su -c 'install -m 0755 -o root -g root -t /usr/local/bin dogecoin-1.14.3/bin/*'

*To continue, choose one of the following options*

1. To use Dogecoin Core Graphical User Interface (GUI), proceed to the [Dogecoin Core GUI](#dogecoin-core-gui) section below.
2. To use the Dogecoin Core daemon (Dogecoind), which is useful for programmers and advanced users, proceed to the [Dogecoin Core Daemon](#dogecoin-core-daemon) section below.
3. To use both the GUI and the daemon, read both the [GUI instructions](#dogecoin-core-gui) and the [daemon instructions](#dogecoin-core-daemon). Note that you can't run both the GUI and the daemon at the same time using the same configuration directory.

## Dogecoin Core GUI

In order to use Dogecoin Core GUI, you will need several libraries installed. All of them should be available in all major recently-released Linux distributions, but they may not be installed on your computer yet. To determine whether you're missing any libraries, open a terminal (if you haven't already) and run the command `/usr/local/bin/dogecoin-qt` to start Dogecoin Core GUI.

If all the required libraries are installed, Dogecoin Core will start. If a required library is missing, an error message similar to the following message will be displayed:

    /usr/local/bin/dogecoin-qt: error while loading shared libraries: libQtGui.so.4: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

Search your distribution's package database for the missing file missing and install package containing that file.  Then re-run `/usr/local/bin/dogecoin-qt` to see if it's missing another file. Repeat until Dogecoin Core GUI starts.

You will be prompted to choose a directory to store the Dogecoin block chain and your wallet.  Unless you have a separate partition or drive you want to use, click *Ok* to use the default.

Dogecoin Core GUI will begin to download the block chain.  This step will take at least several days, and it may take much more time on a slow Internet connection or with a slow computer.  During the download, Dogecoin Core will use a significant part of your connection bandwidth.  You can stop Dogecoin Core at any time by closing it; it will resume from the point where it stopped the next time you start it.

After download is complete, you may use Dogecoin Core as your wallet or you can just let it run to help support the Dogecoin network.

*Optional: Start Your Node At Login*

Starting your node automatically each time you login to your computer makes it easy for you to contribute to the network. The easiest way to do this is to tell Dogecoin Core GUI to start at login. This only works in desktop environments that support the [autostart specification](http://standards.freedesktop.org/autostart-spec/autostart-spec-latest.html#startup), such as Gnome, KDE, and Unity.

While running Dogecoin Core GUI, open the Settings menu and choose Options.  On the Main tab, click *Start Dogecoin on system login*.  Click the Ok button to save the new settings.

The next time you login to your desktop, Dogecoin Core GUI should be automatically started as an icon in the tray.

If Dogecoin Core GUI does not automatically start, you may need to add it to an `.xinit` or `.xsession` file as [described here](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Guide_to_X11/Starting_Sessions).

You have now completed installing Dogecoin Core.

To support the Dogecoin network, you also need to allow incoming connections. Please read the [Network Configuration](#network-configuration) section for details.

## Dogecoin Core Daemon

If you're logged in as an administrative user with sudo access, you may log out. The steps in this section should be performed as the user you want to run Dogecoin Core.  (This can be a locked account used only by Dogecoin Core.)

Type the following command:

    dogecoind -daemon

It will print a message that Dogecoin Core is starting.  To interact with Dogecoin Core daemon, you will use the command `dogecoin-cli` (Dogecoin command line interface).

Note: it may take up to several minutes for Dogecoin Core to start, during which it will display the following message whenever you use dogecoin-cli:

    error: {""code"":-28,""message"":""Verifying blocks...""}

After it starts, you may find the following commands useful for basic interaction with your node: `getblockchaininfo`, `getnetworkinfo`, `getnettotals`, `getwalletinfo`, `stop`, and `help`.

For example, to safely stop your node, run the following command:

    dogecoin-cli stop

When Dogecoin Core daemon first starts, it will begin to download the block chain. This step will take at least several days, and it may take much more time on a slow Internet connection or with a slow computer. During the download, Dogecoin Core will use a significant part of your connection bandwidth. You can stop Dogecoin Core at any time using the `stop` command; it will resume from the point where it stopped the next time you start it.

*Optional: Start Your Node At Boot*

Starting your node automatically each time your computer boots makes it easy for you to contribute to the network.  The easiest way to do this is to start Dogecoin Core daemon from your crontab.  To edit your crontab on most distributions, run the following command:

    crontab -e

Scroll to the bottom of the file displayed and add the following line:

    @reboot dogecoind -daemon

Save the file and exit; the updated crontab file will be installed for you. On most distributions, this will cause Dogecoin Core daemon to be automatically started each time your reboot your computer.

If you're a expert system administrator and want to use an init script instead, see [the init scripts directory in Dogecoin Core's source tree](https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin/blob/0b46a40ed125d7bf4b5a485b91350bc8bdc48fc8/doc/init.md).

You have now completed installing Dogecoin Core.

To support the Dogecoin network, you also need to allow incoming connections. Please read the [Network Configuration](#network-configuration) section for details.

## Windows Instructions

## Windows 10

Go to the [Dogecoin Core download page](https://dogecoin.com/) and download the Dogecoin Core installer to your desktop.

After downloading the file to your desktop or your Downloads folder (`C:\Users\<YOUR USER NAME>\Downloads`), run it by double-clicking its icon. Windows will ask you to confirm that you want to run it. Click Yes and the Dogecoin installer will start.  It's a typical Windows installer, and it will guide you through the decisions you need to make about where to install Dogecoin Core.

*To continue, choose one of the following options*

1. If you want to use the Dogecoin Core Graphical User Interface (GUI), proceed to the [Dogecoin Core GUI](#windows-10-dogecoin-core-gui) section below.
2. If you want to use the Dogecoin Core daemon (Dogecoind), which is useful for programmers and advanced users, proceed to the [Dogecoin Core Daemon](#windows-10-dogecoin-core-daemon) section below.
3. If you want to use both the GUI and the daemon, read both the [GUI instructions](#windows-10-dogecoin-core-gui) and the [daemon instructions](#windows-10-dogecoin-core-daemon). Note that you can't run both the GUI and the daemon at the same time using the same configuration directory.

## Windows 10 Dogecoin Core GUI

Press the Windows key and start typing ""Dogecoin"".  When the Dogecoin Core icon appears (as shown below), click on it.

https://preview.redd.it/gbamjerewxn61.png?width=500&format=png&auto=webp&s=ed76cdfc2cf0fd3e541ecc5aa637b55f30813b22

You will be prompted to choose a directory to store the Dogecoin block chain and your wallet.  Unless you have a separate partition or drive you want to use, click Ok to use the default.

Your firewall may block Dogecoin Core from making outbound connections. It's safe to allow Dogecoin Core to use all networks. (Note: you will still need to configure inbound connections as described later in the [Network Configuration](#network-configuration) section.)

Dogecoin Core GUI will begin to download the block chain.  This step will take at least several days, and it may take much more time on a slow Internet connection or with a slow computer.  During the download, Dogecoin Core will use a significant part of your connection bandwidth.  You can stop Dogecoin Core at any time by closing it; it will resume from the point where it stopped the next time you start it.

The next time you login to your desktop, Dogecoin Core GUI will be automatically started minimized in the task bar.

**Warning**: to prevent data corruption, do not force shutdown of your computer from the Windows shutdown screen when you have Dogecoin Core running.

You have now completed installing Dogecoin Core.

To support the Dogecoin network, you also need to allow incoming connections. Please read the [Network Configuration](#network-configuration) section for details.

## Windows 10 Dogecoin Core Daemon

To start Dogecoin Core daemon, first open a command window: press the Windows key and type ""cmd"".  Choose the option labeled ""Command Prompt"".

https://preview.redd.it/kjvfmf1jwxn61.png?width=497&format=png&auto=webp&s=931c13bfbe08b28699f91182e3406ce5ec43a20b

If you installed Dogecoin Core into the default directory, type the following at the command prompt:

    C:\Program Files\Dogecoin\daemon\dogecoind

Dogecoin Core daemon should start. To interact with Dogecoin Core daemon, you will use the command `dogecoin-cli` (Dogecoin command line interface).  If you installed Dogecoin Core into the default location, type the following at the command prompt to see whether it works:

    C:\Program Files\Dogecoin\daemon\dogecoin-cli getblockchaininfo

Note: it may take up to several minutes for Dogecoin Core to start, during which it will display the following message whenever you use dogecoin-cli:

    error: {""code"":-28,""message"":""Verifying blocks...""}

After it starts, you may find the following commands useful for basic interaction with your node: `getblockchaininfo`, `getnetworkinfo`, `getnettotals`, `getwalletinfo`, `stop`, and `help`.

For example, to safely stop your node, run the following command:

    C:\Program Files\Dogecoin\daemon\dogecoin-cli stop

When Dogecoin Core daemon first starts, it will begin to download the block chain. This step will take at least several days, and it may take much more time on a slow Internet connection or with a slow computer. During the download, Dogecoin Core will use a significant part of your connection bandwidth. You can stop Dogecoin Core at any time using the `stop` command; it will resume from the point where it stopped the next time you start it.

*Optional: Start Your Node At Boot*

Starting your node automatically each time your computer boots makes it easy for you to contribute to the network.  The easiest way to do this is to start Dogecoin Core daemon when you login to your computer.

Start File Explorer and go to:

    C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\StartUp

Right-click on the File Explorer window and choose New, then Text file. Name the file `start_dogecoind.bat`. Then right-click on it and choose Open in Notepad (or whatever editor you prefer). Copy and paste the following line into the file.

    C:\Program Files\Dogecoin\daemon\dogecoind

(If you installed Dogecoin Core in a non-default directory, use that directory path instead.)

Save the file. The next time you login to your computer, Dogecoin Core daemon will be automatically started.

**Warning**: to prevent data corruption, do not force shutdown of your computer from the Windows shutdown screen when you have Dogecoin Core running.

You have now completed installing Dogecoin Core.

You have now completed installing Dogecoin Core.

To support the Dogecoin network, you also need to allow incoming connections. Please read the [Network Configuration](#network-configuration) section for details.

## Upgrading Dogecoin Core

If you are running an older version, shut it down. Wait until it has completely shut down (which might take a few minutes for older versions), then run the installer (on Windows) or just copy over /Applications/Dogecoin-Qt (on Mac) or dogecoind/dogecoin-qt (on Linux).

The blockchain and wallet files in the data directory are compatible between versions so there is no requirement to make any changes to the data directory when upgrading. Occasionally the format of those files changes, but the new Dogecoin Core version will include code that automatically upgrades the files to the new format so no manual intervention is required.

Sometimes upgrade of the blockchain data files from very old versions to the new versions is not supported. In those cases it may be necessary to redownload the blockchain. Check the release notes of the new version if you are planning to upgrade from a very old version.

Sometimes downgrade is not possible because of changes to the data files. Again, check the release notes for the new version if you are planning to downgrade.

## Network Configuration

If you want to support the Dogecoin network, you must allow inbound connections.

When Dogecoin Core starts, it establishes 8 outbound connections to other full nodes so it can download the latest blocks and transactions. If you just want to use your full node as a wallet, you don't need more than these 8 connections---but if you want to support lightweight clients and other full nodes on the network, you must allow inbound connections.

Servers connected directly to the Internet usually don't require any special configuration.  You can use the testing instructions below to confirm your server-based node accepts inbound connections.

Home connections are usually filtered by a router or modem. Dogecoin Core will request your router automatically configure itself to allow inbound connections to Dogecoin's port, port 22556. Unfortunately many routers don't allow automatic configuration, so you must manually configure your router. You may also need to configure your firewall to allow inbound connections to port 22556. Please see the following subsections for details.

## Testing Connections

For confirmation that you accept inbound connections, you can use Dogecoin Core. Dogecoin Core can't tell you directly whether you allow inbound connections, but it can tell you whether or not you currently have any inbound connections. If your node has been online for at least 30 minutes, it should normally have inbound connections. If want to check your peer info using Dogecoin Core, choose the appropriate instructions below:

* [Peer info in Dogecoin Core GUI](#gui-peer-info)
* [Peer info in Dogecoin Core daemon](#daemon-peer-info)

## GUI Peer Info

In the bottom right corner of the Dogecoin Core GUI are several icons. If you hover over the network nodes icon, it will tell you how many connections you have. The icon won't be fully filled in until you have more than 8 active connections, which only happens if inbound connections are allowed.

https://preview.redd.it/74o5wxqkwxn61.png?width=565&format=png&auto=webp&s=d5de61e9e0ebd407b41db89b84b785e0508208a4

For confirmation, you can go to the Help menu, choose Debug Window, and open the Information tab. In the Network section, it will tell you exactly how many inbound connections you have. If the number is greater than zero, then inbound connections are allowed.

https://preview.redd.it/c0xn83gmwxn61.png?width=643&format=png&auto=webp&s=31ddc53868dd5ceb810036b7131cce0d0b4b54ff

If you don't have inbound connections, please read the instructions for [enabling inbound connections.](#enabling-connections)

## Daemon Peer Info

The `getconnectioncount` command will tell you how many connections you have. If you have more than 8 connections, inbound connections are allowed. For example:

    $ dogecoin-cli getconnectioncount
    10

For confirmation, you can use the `getpeerinfo` command to get information about all of your peers.  Each peer's details will include an `inbound` field set to true if the connection is inbound.  If you have any inbound connections, then inbound connections are allowed.

If you don't have inbound connections, please read instructions for [enabling inbound connections.](#enabling-connections)

## Enabling Connections

If Dogecoin Core can't automatically configure your router to open port 22556, you will need to manually configure your router.  We've tried to make the following instructions generic enough to cover most router models; if you need specific help with your router, please ask for help on a tech support site such as [SuperUser](http://superuser.com/).

Enabling inbound connections requires two steps, plus an extra third step for firewall users:

1. Giving your computer a static (unchanging) internal IP address by configuring the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) on your router.
2. Forwarding inbound connections from the Internet through your router to your computer where Dogecoin Core can process them.
3. Configuring your firewall to allow inbound connections. This step mainly applies to Windows users, as Mac OS X and most Linuxes do not enable a firewall by default.

## Configuring DHCP

In order for your router to direct incoming port 22556 connections to your computer, it needs to know your computer's internal IP address. However, routers usually give computers dynamic IP addresses that change frequently, so we need to ensure your router always gives your computer the same internal IP address.

Start by logging into your router's administration interface.  Most routers can be configured using one of the following URLs, so keep clicking links until you find one that works.  If none work, consult your router's manual.

* [http://192.168.0.1](http://192.168.0.1) (some Linksys/Cisco models)
* [http://192.168.1.1](http://192.168.1.1) (some D-Link/Netgear models)
* [http://192.168.2.1](http://192.168.2.1) (some Belkin/SMC models)
* [http://192.168.123.254](http://192.168.123.254) (some US Robotics models)
* [http://10.0.1.1](http://10.0.1.1) (some Apple models)

Upon connecting, you will probably be prompted for a username and password.  If you configured a password, enter it now.  If not, the [Router Passwords site](http://www.routerpasswords.com/) provides a database of known default username and password pairs.

After logging in, you want to search your router's menus for options related to DHCP, the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol.  These options may also be called Address Reservation.

In the reservation configuration, some routers will display a list of computers and devices currently connected to your network, and then let you select a device to make its current IP address permanent:

https://preview.redd.it/ggapzehowxn61.png?width=895&format=png&auto=webp&s=676ed168f3131475109e6a8ce2938de6728887da

If that's the case, find the computer running Dogecoin Core in the list, select it, and add it to the list of reserved addresses. Make a note of its current IP address---we'll use the address in the next section.

Other routers require a more manual configuration. For these routers, you will need to look up the fixed address (MAC address) for your computer's network card and add it to the list. This operation differs by operating system:

* **Windows 7 & 8:** Press Win-R (Windows key plus the R key) to open the Run dialog. Type `cmd` to open the console. Type `ipconfig /all` and find the result that best matches your connection---usually a wireless connection. Look for a line that starts with ""Physical Address"" and contains a value like this:
* **Linux:** open a terminal and type `ifconfig`. Find the result that best matches your connection---a result starting with `wlan` indicates a wireless connection. Find the field that starts with `HWaddr` and copy the immediately following field that looks like 01:23:45:67:89:ab. Use that value in the instructions below.
* **Mac OS X:** open a terminal and type `ifconfig`. Find the result that best matches your connection---a result starting with `en1` usually indicates a wireless connection. Find the field that starts with `ether:` and copy the immediately following field that looks like 01:23:45:67:89:ab. Use that value in the instructions below.

Once you have the MAC address, you can fill it into to your router's manual DHCP assignment table, as illustrated below. Also choose an IP address and make a note of it for the instructions in the next subsection. After entering this information, click the Add or Save button.

https://preview.redd.it/mmv3nglpwxn61.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=86002dc0893424cf851f04e48622c622b4449bc5

Then reboot your computer to ensure it gets assigned the address you selected and proceed to the Port Forwarding instructions below.

## Port Forwarding

For this step, you need to know the local IP address of the computer running Dogecoin Core. You should have this information from configuring the DHCP assignment table in the subsection above.

Login to your router using the same steps described near the top of the [DHCP subsection](#configuring-dhcp).  Look for an option called Port Forwarding, Port Assignment, or anything with ""Port"" in its name.  On some routers, this option is buried in an Applications & Gaming menu.

The port forwarding settings should allow you to map an external port on your router to the ""internal port"" of a device on your network as shown in the screenshot below.

https://preview.redd.it/mnhl1uiqwxn61.png?width=893&format=png&auto=webp&s=feba8220695638974d749ae5000e9cbe4b13de2c

Both the external port and the internal port should be 22556 for Dogecoin. Make sure the IP address you enter is the same one you configured in the previous subsection.

After filling in the details for the mapping, save the entry. You should not need to restart anything. Start Dogecoin Core (if you haven't already) and follow the [Testing Connections](#testing-connections) instructions to test your connection.

I, like many others, first heard about Dogecoin from the Joe Rogan podcast in December of 2020 when Elon Musk was a guest. since then I have been following the Dogecoin community mainly for amusement. This leads me to the title question of How can I help or contribute to the future development of Doge. I have been questioning what I could do (as a novice and new person to coding in general) to learn more and potentially contribute to the future development of Doge. Are there currently Avenues that would allow someone with no Knowledge about coding or Doge to start learning more? What recommendations would someone who's been working as a Doge developer give to an outsider who wants to learn more? These are the types of questions that keep filling my head. The Doge community (from what I've seen) is one of, if not the most supportive online communities I've come across, and I would love to be able to contribute in some way.

Lets start about by defining the issue (extremely quickly), which is the challenge AuxPow is meant to fix or temporarily stay off. We of course need miners maintaining a hash rate to secure our network. These miners are given the incentive of block rewards for their work, which give a predetermined amount of coins for completing work. These block rewards are on a schedule which get less and less over time. Dogecoin's block reward schedule is super fast and has already reduced the coins for completing work to an amount small enough to cause problems. If the value of Dogecoins were high enough, the small block reward would make do and be sufficient incentive for miners. Unfortunately the value of Dogecoin has not followed the reward schedule by increasing in value as the block rewards are decreased as expected. **So our problem is that the value of Dogecoins is too low. We are far enough into our block schedule that our block reward is to low for this low value.**

51% attack is the main issue that the hordes have constantly drummed fear about towards Dogecoin non-stop lately. First, it is a less realistic issue than anyone wants to admit. If any one coordinated mining group could mine stronger than half of everyone else mining Dogecoin, they could write fraudulent transactions. This event can be fixed and the chances of profiting from it are extremely low, but the damage to the coin's confidence, and value would be severe. Even with Dogecoin's current hash rate we are told to fear, it would be massively expensive to 51% attack. We've seen some deceptive numbers thrown around about this lately, but I digress. **It would cost someone lots of money just to hurt our coins value.** We've been hurt worse by the constant fear posts being spread lately, and that was much cheaper than paying for a coordinated 51% attack would be.

AuxPow plans improving this by allowing people that mine other coins, like Litecoin, to share that block with us, as if they mined the same block of Dogecoin. This would give us more hash rate from these other miners and would pay these other miners in Dogecoin to give incentive for their support. **So you would mine both Litecoin and Dogecoin at the same time and get coins from each for each reward of the same mining.**


So, now that we've laid out the plot, lets get to some analysis. We are worried about potential hashrate distribution concerns of 51% attacks, need more hashrate, and plan on merge mining with other coins to get more hashrate. The first questions to ask yourself seem obvious:

 * Is 51% a realistic potential risk?
 * Will AuxPow give us more hashrate?
 * Will this added hashrate alleviate some or all potential 51% risks?
 * Will this added hashrate be more distributed?
 * Will the majority of new AuxPow miners dump our coin pushing it's value down?
 * Can we ever go back from AuxPow safely?
 * Will we be better off with AuxPow?


Currently the 7 largest Litecoin pools have 51% or more as much hashrate as Dogecoin's entire network. Attacking a coin would be pool suicide and would be extremely expensive. **Although there isn't any incentive to do so** in my opinion (because a FUD campaign would be cheaper and have the same result), it is still a risk.

AuxPow should give us a good chunk more of hashrate. The large Litecoin pool, F2Pool has 162 GH/s and already supports AuxPow. With our current 45 GH/s, and assuming we get all of f2pool's hash, we'd still only have 207 GH/s. **This is still only 30% of Litecoin's total hashrate, but leaves only F2Pool with 51% or more of our hashrate (we'll ignore 'unkown' hash sources).**

If we don't quickly lobby for more large pool support, F2Pool will immediately have 78% of our hash rate when we switch. That sounds like a scary situation. Sure they have more than 51% of our hashrate now and any more isn't too relevant as long as they have more than half, but they aren't mining us currently. The only risk now is if they switch to mining us by stopping mining Litecoin. **When we go AuxPow, if we don't have other pools lined up, we are in a very bad situation where F2Pool completely and totally owns Dogecoin.**

AuxPow miners interested purely in profit or other coins will immediately dump their Dogecoins. This will push our coin's value down. This will be as if we opened the flood gates for the largest insta-dumping multi-mining pool ever to ravage our coin's market. The only relief from our value being dumped, will be our fast coin reward schedule. We still have 16 billion+ new Dogecoins to mint by the time the block reward schedule runs out around mid September and switches to perpetual 10 K Dogecoin rewards. That is an additional 18% of our current market cap, a huge amount of coins that will be 15.5% of all our total coins when the schedule ends. Then the perpetual 10 K rewards will kick in adding a new 5.2 billion each year adding another 5% of the total when the schedule ends. We can assume that if we only got F2Pool additionally from AuxPow, that about 80% of all new coins will be dumped at the current value that is about $2.6 Million worth, by mid September, assuming it was to start today. This is a really big issue. Even when our reward schedule runs out, we can assume 4% of our whole market cap will be insta-dumped the first year and if we started today, 12% more of our total ending market will be insta-dumped by September. **With a quickly implemented AuxPow, we should expect values with single digit satoshis.**

After moving to AuxPow, we could change our minds, but it would be too dangerous. We would be stuck allowing AuxPow, and threatening to pull out could lead to larger pools extorting us with the threat of fork, 51%, or destruction of our coin in retaliation. Litecoin's mining pools are big and profit driven. The threat of pool extortion was one of the main reasons Litecoin cited for not resisting ASICs.

Mining hash is low because our value is low making it not rewarding enough. AuxPow is a decision that will trade Dogecoin's value for mining hashpower, putting us in a delicate position, likely at the total mercy of one or two big not very nice Litecoin pools, with no way out. **We should consider alternatives, do the math, and mitigate the many risks. We have many options and are not in the dire immediate catastrophe many would like us to think.**"

I started this in 2018 with the blessing of the Doughwallet Creator Filip Noetzel. I have fixed all of the issues that users previously had with Doughwallet and it is a completely functional Dogecoin wallet for IOS that is vastly improved compared to its predecessor.

0.087,0.812,0.101,-0.3753,"As you know, because Dogecoin uses scrypt like Litecoin does, it's quite a bit more ASIC resilient compared to Bitcoin. This has a major effect on the network, instead of giving the whole mining market away to miners, we're spreading the fun and anyone with a GPU (200kh/s+ for entry level card) or high end CPU (100kh/s?) can join in.

Compare this to the Bitcoin scene, where a top end GPU can get ~800MH/s, but ASIC's can reach 10-50 GH/s now and new ones for 2.5+ **T**H/s are expected in 2014. It's already completely useless to mine with GPU's, but every time a new generation of miners is released, even older ASIC's can't compete - this cold war style arms race will never end.

Our problem is that while scrypt was assumed to be quite ASIC resilient, there seems to be [something](http://doges.org/index.php?topic=7795.0) released soon targeting it, and while 300KH/s for 8W isn't too scary, it's just the start of the arms race, there's no way to predict how far this will go. But there's good news, we can fix it very quickly if we want to - and we still have some time, they need to ship 300000 of those units to double our network hash rate to attack it.

As we're just starting, we still have the ability to fix this by changing the client. It will introduce a hard break in the network - the client update introducing the change will be mandatory, but maybe preventing an arms race is worth the trouble. A potential fix we could use is mentioned in [Vertcoin's annoucement](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=404364.0) - scrypt's ASIC resilience is based on using a large amount of memory per thread, but instead of fixing that at 128KB (N=10, 2^10 = 1024 -> scrypt_**1024**_1_1_256_sp in Dogecoin's source), they use a dynamic N factor that increases every once in a while. Maybe this elaborate system is overkill and we can just decide on increasing N to 12 on block 200000 and call it a day, that will at least force those silly ASIC developers to go back to the drawing board for now while we figure out what to do to kill it forever. By introducing the change on block 200000, we'll have 3 months to get everyone updated with a new client, miners and pools.

I love this community and it would really be a shame if instead of everyone happily mining and tipping, all mining power is concentrated in a few srs businesses with big ASIC's in a year and the only cost effective way to acquire coins is to buy it with dollars from the mining corporations."

0.015,0.899,0.086,0.8541,"I'm curious to understand the development goal of doge with the current market and inflation. 

my understanding is doge goal was to always be an accepted usable currency that can be traded for fiat money and even possibly take the place of fiat money. 

to me - that means the value would sit around the price of fiat money until fiat is no longer used and X amount of doge is traded for 1 pizza. 

currently it's easy to understand the deflation of doge and how much it deflates yearly. which makes it a viable option for a tradeable currency. Why,  cause you don't buy deflationary items with an inflationary object. 


so my question here is -- are the developers still streamlining a goal to make dogecoin a tradeable currency? or have we changed that goal to become an inflationary coin like etherum and btc?"

0.055,0.877,0.068,0.8584,"I'm flattered that some of you think I am Elon because our ideas for improving the coin have been similar.  Reading this will prove I am not, but we are similar types of people.  We are both Scientists, Engineers, Business owners, and primarily Designers.  We are both idealists.  In one of the companies I worked for, I have actually worked with Tesla engineers as our customer on developing a product for them.  I have never seen a company that was as adamant of us developing a product outside our collective comfort zone as Tesla was.  Since we were not willing to ""cut corners"" as we saw them, it made it very difficult.  I left the company before we completed the design process, but I am curious how it played out.

But doing the impossible is what Elon is all about.  I have worked on and built electric cars including being on electric car race teams.  I can tell you that in the field an electric car that goes 0-60 in 3.2 seconds, 11.8 second quarter mile, and 350 mile range for $40,000 that any customer can buy and is road legal, is nothing short of impossible.  Elon does the impossible regularly, and is used to doing it.  Unless I am personally standing on the landing pad watching a rocket de-orbit and see it land right in front of me, I will continue to believe that landing a rocket with it's rocket engines alone from space is impossible.

So Elon will achieve what he is looking for in a coin, with or without us.  And I can tell you that if it is without us, Doge will go back to $0.01.  His ask is not even that impossible, and is what the community has been pushing towards anyway.

100x fee reduction is something all of us have been wanting.  Heck I think it should be reduced 200x.  Currently Bitcoin Cash has a 1000x cheaper fee than we do, and they are not having any spam problems and their blocks are not full.  Litecoin also has well under 1 cent min transaction fee.  Same with Bitcoin SV and Digibyte.  And unlike these coins, we never have to rely on fees to pay miners since we have a tail emission. This goal is trivial to meet.

10x Blocksize is also not a problem at all.  Many coins have max blocksize this big or bigger with no issues.  Our blocks are basically empty right now.  So obviously we haven't even needed a max blocksize to keep blockchain growth under control.  Average Blocksize will regulate itself which has been shown in all coins including bitcoin, as it took years for them to fill up their first block.

10x reduced blocktime is not that far fetched.  As we know it it is basically impossible for a Proof of Work coin to do 6 second blocktimes with current network effects and technology.  But 10 seconds is in the realm of possibility, and heck, 15 second blocktimes are downright practical; Digibyte has a 15 second blocktime and their orphan rate is currently well under 10%.  In terms of this metric, I propose we take it slow and start with a 30 second blocktime and assess our orphan rate and also syncing metrics.  Our coin will probably struggle achieving very fast blocktimes more so than other coins because we are merged mined and our nonce is routinely in other coins (not just litecoin, we are merge mined with all scrypt coins) blockchains.  Also segwit will likely hurt syncing as well as we will now have 3 places that our data can be; other blockchains for the nonce, transaction blocks for the transactions, and signature blocks for signatures - all of which have to be synced.

Anyway, why not try?  These are all things the community wanted anyway.  We can do the first 2 with no problem, and can work towards the 3rd.  I'm sure Elon would be willing to deploy some satellite and/or fiber nodes to help us achieve the 3rd, and wouldn't that be some cool PR?

Also leaders of Dogecoin need to be customer focused.  Elon is a large customer - one who has caused our price to rise more than any other.  The rest of the community are all customers too, and if we look at them with disdain and judge their motives, that is the farthest thing from customer service we can do.  Of course we have some guiding principles we cannot revoke such as Proof of Work, a coin with our own blockchain (not to become a token), Layer-1 on-chain scaling, and a Tail Emission (un-capped supply).  But when it comes to a roadmap on improving the coin, we should be listening to our customers."

the switch-over to AuxPoW go smoothly, the whole process was exceptionally
straight-forward in the end, given the scale of the undertaking.

Before we go further, one of the biggest remaining issues with the adoption of
AuxPoW has been the few miners left behind on the 1.7 branch, and especially
the p2pool miners. The existing p2pool sharechain is no longer producing
valid shares, and CohibAA79 has set up a new sharechain and written a [guide
to switching over to the new sharechain](http://www.reddit.com/r/dogemining/comments/2gxmla/doge_p2pool_updated_for_18_fork_please_test/).
If everyone can help get miners switched over to the new sharechain, that
would be extremely positive for the health of Dogecoin mining.

I also want to take a moment to thank all our miners, who have stuck with us through
thick and thin, and I know are badly hurting from the increased difficulty; your
loyalty is appreciated, and I deeply regret that we found ourselves in a position
where this was the only viable option, however I hope you can take comfort from the
increased security of the coin.

The hashrate jump has been huge; we've gone from 60GH/s to 750-850GH/s. I know
there was alarm about F2Pool's percentage of hashrate the morning after AuxPoW
was adopted, as it passed 50% of our hashrate at peak. What hasn't been clear
I think is that that hashrate was always out there, and a risk to Dogecoin if
the pool security was compromised, it just was not clearly visible before. In
fact, previously several Litecoin pools had hashrate in excess of the Dogecoin
hashrate, which was the primary reason why we had to adopt AuxPoW.

So, right now, Dogecoin is stable, with a solid reference client and hashrate
sufficient to keep us safe. The primary mining phase is 92% complete, the
4th halvening expected around a week and a half from now. and two further halvenings
after that before we hit steady-state mining. Dogecoin Core 1.8.1 is being finished
off and should go into large scale tests next weekend.

From a developer point of view, mostly we're winding down a bit, enjoying
not having a pending crisis of any kind, and preparing for the next stages.
Personally I'm catching up with the real world a bit and other projects that
need my attention.

I'm anticipating that hashrate will have a further significant jump as 2nd
generation Scrypt ASIC miners are deployed. You can already see this pushing
Litecoin's hashrate past 1TH/s at peak, and as other mining hardware producers
ship their ASICs we'll see that increase further.

My next main priority is to make it easier for users to adopt Dogecoin; the
reference client takes too long to set up, Multidoge breaks if you mine into
it, and the Android client is excellent but only suitable for some phones and
tablets. I want to look at improving Multidoge, or potentially working on a new
lightweight (SPV) client, so that new users can get started with Dogecoin
within minutes, not hours. Eager Java developers could look at
[Multidoge](https://github.com/langerhans/multidoge), or C# developers could
look at [BitSharp](https://github.com/pmlyon/BitSharp) which we're considering
adapting to support Dogecoin.

On a less technical note, we still need to help make Dogecoin more useful.
That means encouraging more merchants and service providers, and for that
we need to actually get spending again. From reports I hear, we were by far
the most active altcoin in terms of usage at one time, and we're now a very
long way down, so please lets get back to using Dogecoin as a currency.

Limit wallet size to say 1 420 069 coins to prevent whales from being able to manipulate the price of the coin

Describe Preferred Solution
Reduce maximum wallet size to 1 420 069

Describe Alternatives
Asking external parties like SEC to prevent market manipulation, which they won't do.

Whales need to buy a lot of coins in order to manipulate the price down by dumping the coins that they bought, if we have a decentralised exchange like metamask where you can swap BTC for DOGE to a maximum wallet size of say 1 420 069 it solves the problem of price volatility to a massive extent. If the volatility is reduced, adoption will follow like a tsunami. Elon will ove this idea because it deals with the price manipulation.

DOGE would absolutely stand out as the peoples coin and solicit mass adoption if the price increase was natural/organic.

Please look at this issue again, getting this sorted is MASSIVE!

Nothing is set in stone yet, but it looks like we will make a hard fork around block 160.000-200.000 that will remove the random rewards to combat multipool abuse, and increase the time until mined coins are available to spend in order to provide more security in case of a fork. Likely the difficulty calculation is going to change as well, more changes are proposed.

If you want to chime in on these decisions or think we need other improvements that would require a fork, the time to discuss it is now. [Discussions are happening over on github, not on reddit](https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin/issues?direction=desc&page=1&sort=updated&state=open)"

0.057,0.786,0.156,0.9985,"With current fee policies, for most transactions, 1 DOGE fee is enough. This requirement does not depend on Dogecoin value, it is set to always be 1 DOGE per 1000 bytes (roughly speaking). The advantage of this rigid policy is that it‚Äôs deterministic. When wallet software creates a transaction, it knows exactly what fee will be required for it. Users don‚Äôt have to pay more than enough and don‚Äôt have to risk their transactions getting stuck because of insufficient fee. Kludges like RBF (replace by fee) are not needed for Dogecoin. Sadly, most Dogecoin wallet software calculates fee incorrectly, paying either insufficient or excessive fee. It so happens that many Dogecoin users don‚Äôt benefit from rigid fee policy.

Currently, 1 DOGE fee is not expensive in my opinion. But it may become expensive/uncompetitive in the future if Dogecoin value will raise. Of course, this would be great for Dogecoin holders, but it does not justify the disadvantage for new users who may not be so rich. Cheap and fast transactions was always a strong and advertised point of Dogecoin. Moving forward, we need to think about how Dogecoin will be able to adapt to changing situation while staying true to its values.

Before we discuss any changes to fee policies, we need to understand the role of transaction fees in Dogecoin. Transactions don‚Äôt have to compete for space in Dogecoin blocks, there is always space for all transactions. If in the future Dogecoin will be used so much that current block size limit will not be enough, we can raise the limit, so high fee will never be required for transaction confirmation. For mining, fees are not essential, because block reward and merge mining is enough to secure the network. So why require transaction fee at all? In the past, certain amount of free transactions was allowed.

The main function of transaction fees is to prevent trashing the block chain with unnecessary transactions. If all transactions were free, someone could create so many transactions that they would fill blocks, putting strain on Dogecoin network and making it harder for legitimate transactions to get confirmed. Different measures can be used to prevent this situation:

1. transaction fees;
2. limiting money velocity (i. e. requiring coins to sit for some time after they were moved);
3. requiring proof of work.

Dogecoin was using options 1 and 2, limiting velocity for free transactions and requiring fee for transactions that don‚Äôt qualify for free tier. Then it switched to requiring fee for all transactions. As for the third option, we are unlikely to use it because it presents a problem for low-powered devices, and it‚Äôs not worth complexity that we‚Äôd have to add to the system. We are likely to stick with option 1.

The optimal fee requirement is minimal fee that‚Äôs enough to discourage creating unnecessary transactions. When expressed in DOGE, this optimal amount will be changing with changing value of Dogecoin and other factors. If we are to change fee policy, it has to be closer to this optimal value than current policy. Although the optimal value is not known precisely, it depends on unknown factors, like what motivation one may have to attack Dogecoin. So with the optimum being unknown and changing, it may be difficult to compare candidate policies. But perhaps, we could agree on some value that most would consider too high, then a better policy would be one that requires less than that. Also, we need to define what transactions are unnecessary. In my opinion, any transaction that is reasonably needed for something good is necessary.

Now to what it will take to change fee policies. Fortunately, fees are not determined by the consensus algorithm, and we will not need to change the Dogecoin protocol. On the other hand, miners and transaction senders (wallet providers, services) need to agree on the policy so that senders will know what fee will be required for their transactions to be confirmed. So when we come up with a proposal, we should get all these parties on board. Technically, fee requirement is determined solely by miners. One way to change their requirement is to change the default in Dogecoin Core; many are not interested in changing from these defaults. But not all miners update to the latest version, so we still need to talk to them.

Current fee requirement currently is OK (at least in my opinion), we don‚Äôt need to change it right now. Rather, we need to be ready to change it when it will be needed. I feel that as of now we are not ready. Miners don‚Äôt care about this stuff. Most third-party software developers don‚Äôt bother learning Dogecoin specifics, they often just reuse code that works with other similar cryptocurrencies. We don‚Äôt have a plan. Let‚Äôs discuss how we can change that and prepare for the bright future, in case it will come."

Amazon's [Mechanical Turk](https://www.mturk.com) is a place where you can set up small, often repetetive tasks for people to do for small money rewards. It's good for things like data gathering, video transcription, audio transcription where the audio is too garbled for software, things like that where a human brain has advantages over a computer.

Most jobs are small; they take a couple of seconds, and are worth like 5 cents.

But there's a huge runaround when it comes to processing the payments. It goes to your amazon payments, which is fine if you just want money to buy stuff on amazon. But if you want to use it anywhere else (like say, if you want to transfer it to paypal) then you have to either buy a giftcard for the service from amazon, or you have to transfer it through a bank which could take weeks.

This seems like a perfect place for cryptocurrencies; They're nigh-instant, decentralized, and relatively easy to either use online, or transfer to fiat money through one of the exchanges.

But doing it in bitcoin would mean each job would be worth like, .0000001 coin or something. That's a little ridiculous to deal with.
Doge on the other hand... Doge might just work. Until it goes to the moon, anyway.

And a service like this, directly linking a source of labor to doge? A place where people can go to do small tasks and earn doge right away? That might just take it a long long way toward the moon.

In order for the AuxPoW fork to go smoothly, we need as many (ideally all) users to move to the new client before block 371337. While the community is generally very active and involved, a lot of those who run services and businesses involving Dogecoin miss these announcements.

So today, I've been building up a list of charities, exchanges, faucets, gaming sites, merchants, mining pools, payment processors, tipbots and wallets and trying to contact as many of them about the update as I feasibly can. This is no small task; there are over 100 merchants alone, let alone other groups, and many directories are out of date so finding which companies actually use Dogecoin isn't trivial either. This will continue with support from others (/u/langer_hans and /u/sporklin included) over the coming weeks, as we mark off those who come back with positive confirmations, and chase up any high-impact services (exchanges, payment processors) who do not come back in a timely manner.

This is partly also a technical support task, with 2-3 hours spent resolving build issues one exchange had, and ensuring that the resulting build was well tested and stable.

As an aside, if you run any of these services and haven't heard from me yet, we are going to be sending out messages for a long term, and if we miss anyone (which we undoubtedly will), we do care, we just don't have perfect lists unfortunately.

0.005,0.906,0.089,0.9731,"Since i got a request in DM to explain a bit more about how to verify the trusted build process, and this is something that is requested sporadically, I thought I'd just share this with everyone for visibility.

Gitian is a process invented by the bittorrent team that ensures that no code was injected maliciously. Every step of the build process is hashed and can be reproduced by anyone and then compared to signatures from multiple builders. It is a LOT of work to set it up, but worth it if you want to be sure that the devs did not lie to you.

If you just want to check if your binary is the signed one, and you're on, say windows 64-bit, you take one of the signer's lists that were published and dig out the sha256, eg: https://github.com/dogecoin/gitian.sigs/blob/master/1.14.2-win/langerhans/dogecoin-win-1.14-build.assert#L8

The lists of hashes are signed with PGP keys that you can find in https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin/tree/master/contrib/gitian-keys

the dir tree structure of https://github.com/dogecoin/gitian.sigs is: `<version>-<platform>/signer/` so you'd normally take one of the signers for a release and check if your binary matches the hash.

On linux/osx (and possibly WSL but I have never tested that) you can then automagically compare asserts and sigs for a release by cloning https://github.com/devrandom/gitian-builder and then:

1. Getting the descriptors from https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin
2. Cloning https://github.com/dogecoin/gitian.sigs
3. running `gverify`

so let's say you put it all in one place, you do something like:

    git clone https://github.com/devrandom/gitian-builder
    git clone https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin
    git clone https://github.com/dogecoin/gitian.sigs
    pushd dogecoin
    git checkout v1.14.3
    popd

and then you can check all v1.14.3 binary signatures with something like:

    for platform in osx linux win; do 
      gitian-builder/bin/gverify -r 1.14.3-$platform \
        --destination ./gitian.sigs/ \
        ./dogecoin/contrib/gitian-descriptors/gitian-$platform.yml;
    done

If you really want to be 100% sure, you can run the entire build process yourself and compare your output with the published outputs, using the script i wrote for 1.14.3: https://gist.github.com/patricklodder/fcffff8af0df78bdfb2957581c7368e5"

An ""intro"" URL generator.

**The use-case:**

I'm at a bar, and want to tip the waitress in Dogecoin. She only has an iPhone, so I can't say ""Install the Dogecoin app"" to then send her the tip. Instead, I have to get her to sign up for an online wallet. Aint nobody got time for that!

**The solution**:

I go to dogeintro.com (or fire up an app, whatever), where I have a bunch of tipping dogecoin stored. I hit a button to create a new ""Redeemable Info URL"" - This gives me something like dogeintro.com/sdgr6j4 (a short url that's got no ambiguous characters).

I then give this URL to the waitress as the tip.

The waitress visits this URL and is presented with a page that says something really simple like: 

> *jesstelford tipped you 30,000 Dogecoin (~USD $10)*
>
> [What is this?](http://reddit.com) | [Redeem your Dogecoin now!](http://reddit.com)

There would be super simple ""Getting started"" info behind the ""What is this?"" link, and the ""Redeem"" link would allow them the opportunity to send the coins elsewhere (their regular wallet, etc).

Then as the sender of the tip, I can see when someone redeems a tip I give them, and can refill my account easily, etc. Basically, it's the digital equivalent of a paper wallet - I shouldn't need to get their email address, or have them sign up for anything to be able to send them the tip.

As we've had several discussions about Coinbase integration lately and one of the requirements from Coinbase is that there is a maintained Rosetta API implementation for every asset they list, complying with this requirement is good for Dogecoin. This also further improves commonalities with other coins that implemented this API, which means that development towards this can serve much more than just the Coinbase requirement.

I would also like to credit /u/tazz_2004 who worked on the integration of Travis into the Github repository, to automate testing of submitted changes.

We calculated and requested a payout for the work on 1.7 of 870,000 DOGE. This was based on the ~1,000,000 DOGE being donated less 15% kept in, in case of immediate payment needs, and then equally distributed to the main contributors and the individual share for the mentioned patch.

The fund-holder opted, unsolicited, to pay these amounts from their own funds instead, and further added bonuses of up to 25% of the amounts each. As such, the retained sum in the fund is being rolled forward to
fund development of 1.7.2, as well as cover any unanticipated requirements. Other contributions since the 1.7 release mean the current total balance stands at around 1,300,000 DOGE.

0.07,0.785,0.145,0.9791,"So this is a bit of a far away discussion, for many many decades into the future.   


One problem with most crypto currency is it's FAR too deflationary to be an economic driver. Excess monetary supply results in run away inflation, but too little can lead to *run away deflation* that can be just as disastrous, historically speaking. For example the silver shortage that is thought to have contributed to the collapse of the Ming dynasty.   


Dogecoin is much more suited to this balance of supply and demand with it's supply rate, however, in say 50 to 100 years, dogecoins supply rate may become theoretically too low (as it approaches 0%). So I propose a sort of opposite bitcoin halving - '**Dogecoin Doubling**'.   


When supply increase mathematically falls under let's say 1% per annum (or some other figure, take your pick I'm just guessing), you double the mining rewards. This way it never falls too far below the average economic growth of 2%, and thus shouldn't have the potential for a deflationary spiral due to a wide mismatch of supply and demand.    


It would be best to set a set level of supply increase at which this occurs, so that it was not open to outside influence or central party manipulation. Setting it below average economic growth allows for some natural value appreciation once the market is fully saturated (as opposed to the value depreciation of fiat).   


Now, I know this is a very very future thing, and well, not at all something we are are certain would become an issue. I simply propose it now, so that the idea is floated for future generations of developers, miners and hodlers - should dogecoin ever become a substantial part of the global economy."

https://www.bustabit.com/

Except replace it with a different UI. Something like a Shiba cartoon basketball player that can take shots with a ‚ÄúDoge Ball‚Äù (cost 1 Doge) and shoot from different spots on the court where the multipliers would be different (2x, 3x, 5x, 10x). Using the underlying engine from bustabit to determine if the shot is successful or not and getting a payout. Take a small fee from each shot to donate to a national animal rescue program or some good cause like that. Team up with Mark Cuban and brand it with the Dallas Mavs possibly. Thoughts?"

So it has been 3 months since the last update. I have made some progress, fix stuff I broke and added new things.

Here what has been changed : 

* Refactored the interface in order to make it easy to add new screen.
* Allow entering amount and copy/paste address.
* Fixes what I have broken last time :)

I want now to do packaging for a testnet beta version. Let me know if you are interested in helping testing and for which system. It has been written in nodejs and should work on every platform but computers.. meh.

In the meantime I will add more tests and review the current code. Unfortunately payment channel will not come soon.

If anyone want to help on this project, every contribution is welcomed.

Stable version of the code can be find on this repo : [https://github.com/BitcoinAmiens/dogecoin-spv-node/](https://github.com/BitcoinAmiens/dogecoin-spv-node/)

0.015,0.877,0.108,0.9877,"We are getting ready to release v2 of the API, but first we wanted to show you guys what we are planning so you can tell us if we are heading in the right direction.  Based on the feedback of our users, we plan to implement the following new features and functions:

**Features**

* Users for your wallet so you can easily manage multiple user balances without having to keep track of withdrawals on your end.

* Implement oauth as an option to use the API instead of the api_key.

* Better response formatting, with data and error fields in the JSON response.

* Require pin to withdraw if not using OAuth.

* HTTP response codes.

**New Functions**

* create_user(id [alphanumeric]) creates a new user and returns new address for that user

* get_user_address(id [alphanumeric]) returns the address assigned to the user

* get_user_balance(id [alphanumeric]) returns the current balance of the user

* withdraw_from_user(id [alphanumeric], amount_doge [double], payment_address [alphanumeric], label [label (optional)]) returns true on success

* move_to_user(amount_doge [double], id_to [alphanumeric], id_from [alphanumeric (optional)]) returns successful, if id_from isnt set it moves it from the main wallet.

* get_users() returns a list of all the users associated with the account and their balances

* get_transactions( num [int], user_id [alphanumeric (optional)],  type [string (optional)], label [label (optional)], payment_address [alphanumeric (optional)]) returns an array of the last num transactions matching the options

* get_network_hashrate() returns the current network hashrate

* update get_current_price to have options for BTC, USD, and amount doge to be converted

**New Account Settings**

* Turn off api_key and api access in settings (this will be the default for new users) and add options for OAuth.

* Reset api_key.

* Recover username and reset pin through email.

* Option to allow only requests from a specific domain/ip address for API.

This should make it quite a bit easier for people using the API who need to track lots of users.  With OAuth and some new account settings we will give the user more control over the security of their account.

What did we miss? What would you like to see?"

After months of mining and my Ati GPU melting my friend got a new computer and I decided the best and easiest way to get him my most commonly used programs was to literally take my hard drive and plug it in his PC and copy everything.
Needless to say, fried the whole hard drive. If I had to guess the reason why, it was really cold so probably some condensation got on the electronics and when I plugged in the power it short circuted.
It had several BTC on it since BTC were stored locally on HDD at the time.

I didn't even think it was a big deal at the time, I was more bummed about losing the hard drive than the BTC, but the experience made me never really mine again due to wasted electricity/GPU stress/and seeing how easily it can all be lost.

Im from Chile, and my mother died of covid, i wasn't that close to her, but that just was the beginning. Im the first in the family that could entry in college, so i have a lot of hopes in my shoulders, specially from my grandmother, that keeps saying that she will die only after i graduate. The thing is that i had to put a lot of money on the funeral, im eating just like instant noodles and crap. Im now in red numbers, all of this unexpected payments left me absolutely broke, and my college called me that the renewal of my scholarship was denied for this last trimester and obviously my family cant help me, i live alone and the only people that i have left are my grandparents, who live in a solidary payment from the government, so it is pretty hard to me for get some cash, the minimum salary for a part time job (because im studying) is less than 280 usd, maybe just that in the best case scenario, and that is not enough for living and paying college. I have 2 options, just leave college, because they will not give me any oportunity, start working and forget about it and keep the cycle of an uneducated family. And the other option somehow get some cash, work in the nightime and study in the daytime, but i will probably fail college with that, im currently in it, but i really dont know what to do, any recommendation is welcome, i really needed to bring all of this out, thanks for anyone that read this.

 In my country the dollar is a big thing, so anything is a lot, i made an btc and doge wallet, if anyone can help me i swear that somehow i will return the favor.

0.093,0.8,0.106,0.5118,"Hi guys, today I want to tell you my story.  And yes, I will ask you for help at the end of the story, that's the point anyway.

First of all, let me introduce myself so you can understand the story better.  I am a 21 year old college student and have been interested in crypto for about 1.5 years.  That's enough, let's get started.  When Covid-19 first came out, my dorm expenses were reduced and I did not know where to spend the money.  I said to myself, why not buy crypto?  How could I have known that after that day, HODL addiction would be in my blood?  I was transferring all the money I got to crypto assets, I never went out, I did not go out with my friends, I lived as if I had no money.  For months, I turned all my money into crypto and HODLed it. 

Actually, I didn't want to keep it forever, those who are students know, my goal was to have a comfortable life when schools opened. When I said everything was just as I planned, things didn't go well (that's why you're here already stupid).Problems in my life started to grow one by one.  Those who HODL know, when the coin you hold rises, you are looking for someone to share your joy with and you tell everyone.  Yes, that's what I was doing, and now everyone around me knew I had money. My brother, mother and friends started asking me for a loan one by one.  My brother is a lawyer, quit his job and decided to become a stand-up artist, but he was not working, he was constantly writing scripts for stand-up shows.  I paid to his expenses for months.  I was an idiot trying to please everyone around me.  I lent a lot of money to my friends who were in trouble (many of them not paid back). It was all pretty shitty, but I still had enough money when the schools opened and I was able to make a living. As time passed, a beautiful girl entered my boring and shitty life.  After a while we became lovers.  When I met him, I was forgetting everything, everything was great. I was in a perfect relationship. 


As time passed, my brother said that he had finally set the stage for a stand-up show, but they wanted a large amount of money to rent it. It was the end of the road for him now, he needed this money to realize his dreams after all this time, otherwise everything would be for nothing.I gave him the rest of my coins and I had a small amount left, it was't much but it was still enough amount, but it could run out quickly because I quit my full time job because the schools opened and I also had a girlfriend. I argued with most of my friends because I wanted them to pay their debts back.I had no proper friends left, only my girlfriend and family.


I had no long-term funds and had to do something.  And I started gambling.I won't lie, I won for a while, but I was greedy, after the money that was gone, the money I earned from gambling was not enough. I gambled again on a Sunday.  I was depositing the money piece by piece.  I lost constantly, I lost my cash in a short time.  I was blinded, I had to get back the money I lost.  That day, I did what I have never done in my life for the first time, I withdrawed my HODLed coins for myself. I didn't win at all that day, I lost everything.After that day, I realized that I was actually a HODL addict.

  I don't know if you would believe it, but I never felt sorry for the money I lost.  However, the disgusting feeling of watching the chart when I didn't have any coins made me sad. Every time DOGE and other coins increase, I was crying, thinking about how I would buy it at this price. Maybe if I entered the market for the first time months later when I had money, these prices would not upset me.  However, after the prices I have seen for 1.5 years, this situation is driving me crazy.


Anyway, let's get to the point, I don't want to blow your mind too much.  Like other people, I'm not asking you to DOGE for any expenses. I ask for HODL it over the years.  This time I won't tell anyone that I've HODLed, and I will keep the coins in this wallet for years. I will send you proof whenever you want. Thanks bois.

0.016,0.832,0.152,0.9942,"Hello folks, newbie here. My brother introduced me to the subject of cryptocurrency about a month ago and now I'm hooked. I just couldn't stop using my laptop and mobile, and my browser tab filled with all the faucets in the world :D.  So far to this point my favorite tokens are doge and TRX, simply becuz they seem affordable to me as being world popular tokens. They also says i can stake with TRX, whichi really interested to do:) I like ADA/Cardano too, very much, but it is expensive for me.  As a interestee who happened to be in a developing country(doesn't even have paypal service: ()  my interest can't go up as much as i really wanted to be. For example even if i got extra cash to spare in hand i really can't invest with them to any of the tokens becuz there's no internet paying service provider to my place as far as i awared of(might been my lack of knowledge though). Most of these days, I've been really wanting to hold some amount of crypto tokens. I really do!  Love the overall idea regarding decentralization, and the blockchain technology in general. As soon as i heard stuffs from my brother i know I gonna be into this one.
That being said,  every inputs into my disposal would much much appreciated. Just so you know beforehand, these cryptos will be stay in my wallet for some time until i learn more of the subject of cryptocurrency and trading at the exchangers.

Right now though I'm only doing faucets all over the place, days and night without much sleep. Got a multicoins wallet at Trust. In consideration of utilizing binance exchange in the future when i found a way for a payment service+much much more knowledge into the subject. Doge, trons, shiba, and ADA, every inputs would worth millions for me :D And thanks in advance to all potential givers. 
And also please do lecture me anytime in the future regarding to crypto stuffs, I'll be much appreciated."
0.148,0.818,0.034,-0.9562,"Well I wanted to learn and understand the crypto market and about investing in general, so I started to buy crypto a few months ago.  I impatiently made hundreds of trades, eventually getting into futures with leverage.  Needless to say, I've lost every penny I've ever put into crypto and then some.  I could use a break.

When I say I could use a break, I mean I could use a stroke of luck or a mysterious benefactor, because I foolishly used our Biden stimulus money to try and ""grow it"" using crypto, because it seemed possible.  The truth is, it's probably possible, but for me, the risks seem to stack up until they're just too much to bear, and the whole mess just collapses.

Lesson learned...don't trade derivatives with leverage in crypto, even with tight stop-losses.  You can literally get killed by just network latency alone on a one percent swing."

I'm not very good at this, since I try my best to stay absolutely humble and also hold on to pride like nothing else. I have been doing youtube, twitch and other social medias for many years now and I've never pushed myself hard enough to follow it fully which is why I'm here, begging...  


If you grew up in a house that always had food or money for it then you've already lived a life better than me. I live in London, UK and you're probably thinking, that's an A-Tier (or at least B) country and city, he must be doing okay..  


For the better part of 14 years I have lived on the breadline, just enough money to have food on the table and bills paid whilst working but this pandemic hit me hard in two ways.  
First of all up until March 2019 I was working as an events technician for live events.  
Some of these involved Quakecon Europe and the ASOS Christmas party to name a few, I was living okay but still had a debt I was paying off, some could say I was ""comfortable"".  
Secondly it struck at home when I stopped recieving clients for my website design services, which are now somewhat lacking due to months of not much work.  
([https://collab.stream](https://collab.stream) \- a site I've been setting up over the last few days to try and generate some income and provide entertainment online).  


I've had so much free time that previous hobbies don't feel the same, instead of hobbies they became work for a time, even simple things like gaming and it wasn't good for me as it made me lazy. What better time than when you're trapped indoors anyway.  
I've had business ideas, I've had great plans and I've failed them all because I don't earn enough to survive in London.  


You can pay me in doge if you'd like a small sum to keep me fed would be awesome, but if you could donate instead some of your time to get to know me, bring me your aspirations and show me what kind of website you want built if any.. even if it's just for fun, a simple game or a few pages about yourself, something to keep me occupied and working rather than just a simple donation. I want to earn it, I just don't see the opportunity arrising in the current economic downturn.  


Thanks for your time reading this, I'm almost certain not much will come of it but anything is worth a try at this point.  


Kind Regards,

I don't wanna impress anyone with a sobbing story, but I'm really trying to look for some human kindness, even though I kinda know that this post will be totally ignored, but I will give it a try anyway since I'm a bit desperate. Time to share a summary of my story:

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Basically, I am a 20 yo and I live in a developing country, my parents got divorced when I was a baby and that kinda screw things up a little, since my mom had to raise me by herself, even though she was alone with me she tried to give her best to give me a good upbringing and made sure that I don't miss anything material speaking, but even tho I was a kid I kinda knew that we were poorer than the average person. 3 years ago she fell into chronic depression due to peer pressure and being humiliated and treated badly at work, basically she is a very soft person, and people took advantage of her. As she feel deeper and deeper into her depression, soon she was not able to go to work since now she is even afraid to go out of the house, I have to walk with her everyday around the house so she would not rot in bed. Since she was not able to go to work anymore, we ended up relaying only on me to bring food on the table, I work a very shitty minimum wage job which in my country is 564 USD per month, after paying the bills we are not left with much, barely affording food because some of the medication she takes it is not payed in full by the state, basically we are living day by day. Most of the family cut ties with us because they view me and my mom as failures and to be honest..we kinda are. I don't think I can hold on much longer, I can already feel how my mental state begins to decay, the only purpose that kinda keeps me from slipping away is that I have to care for my mom as she cared for me when I was little.

&#x200B;

I know that I am not entitled to anyone's money, and I am so deeply sorry and ashamed for what I am doing right now, but I don't know what to do anymore.

A little bit of a back story. I had posted a few times in the past on this sub about the P2P classifieds style site for trading dogecoin [showmethedoge.com](https://www.showmethedoge.com/) that I made. I was frustrated by the big exchanges' crazy withdrawal fees and red tape so I made my own site (not a dev but I did my best).

Unfortunately, there just wasn't much use despite pretty good support that I got from the community.

I'm now willing to SELL the site, domain, and any trademark/IP if anyone is interested and thinks they can make it work. The domain is too good of a domain to just waste! lol

PM me if you are interested and want to make an offer.

And yes...we'll accept Dogecoin.

Last Wednesday a call came in from a 28 year old mother of two to her brother. She called from a bed she had been in for 3 days, she was dying. Two years before, she started using heroin and there she was ready to dying on bed in the dealers house. She was rushed to the hospital and put in the ICU with a heart rate at 30 and blood pressure 85/50. With no veins left, they had to flip her over and put an IV in her neck. They said the test came back saying she had bacteria on her heart and possible infection on her heart. Then they started searching, scoping her, ultrasound and even putting dye in her blood. All to find nothing! Her vitals all came back and in 4 days she left the hospital with a slightly low heart rate. She knew this was a sign, if she doesn't do something, she will be dead within hours. She left her two babies, 7 and 5 years old, with their father. She said, ""mommy's sick and has to go away to get better but when I get back I won't be sick anymore!"" Then in the middle of detoxing she took herself to rehab and checked in. Now this is where we need the Amazing doge community to help. Rehab is not cheap but those two babies need their mother. Coming from a home with a drug addicted father herself, this is her chance to break the cycle. She knows what she has to do and is determined to be the mother she once was, the mother her kids need. Can the Doge save this family? Doing only good everyday!

Last Wednesday a call came in from a 28 year old mother of two to her brother. She called from a bed she had been in for 3 days, she was dying. Two years before, she started using heroin and there she was dying on bed in the dealers house. She was rushed to the hospital and put in the ICU with a heart rate at 30 and blood pressure 85/50. With no veins left, they had to flip her over and put an IV in her neck. They said the test came back saying she had bacteria on her heart and possible infection on her heart. Then they started searching, scoping her, ultrasound and even putting dye in her blood. All to find nothing! Her vitals all came back and in 4 days she left the hospital with a slightly low heart rate. She knew this was a sign, if she doesn't do something, she will be dead within hours. She left her two babies, 7 and 5 years old, with their father. She said, ""mommy's sick and has to go away to get better but when I get back I won't be sick anymore!"" Then in the middle of detoxing she took herself to rehab and checked in. Now this is where we need the Amazing doge community to help. Rehab is not cheap but those two babies need their mother. Coming from a home with a drug addicted father herself, this is her chance to break the cycle. She knows what she has to do and is determined to be the mother she once was, the mother her kids need. Can the Doge save this family? Doing only good everyday!

Does anyone know if there is a specific file type or file name that I should be searching for to help me find this old wallet?  It could save me a lot of time if I can search for a specific file instead of having to boot up the o/s on every hard drive, many of which will also contain VM's.

0.138,0.778,0.084,-0.9756,"I have a close friend who is about to lose her home of more than 20 years. Both of her parents died, neither leaving a will, life insurance policies, or cash to take care of final expenses. The mortgage company refused to work with my friend because she was not on the mortgage. She is the sole caretaker of her disabled brother and they have no other living family members to turn to for assistance. Before my friend's mother died, she had to fight to get guardianship over her because she was mentally incapable of taking care of anything, not even the final arrangements for her husband. My friend has struggled for years, trying to keep a roof over her and her disabled brother's heads, while trying to work a low-paying job, deal with legal and financial matters on her own, and take care of a mentally ill parent and disabled brother. It has been a very difficult decade for her. Her father died several years ago and her mother died a year and a half ago. The loss of two parents, no wills, no money to afford probate costs in Nevada, no kindness or cooperation from creditors or the mortgage company, and a heavily-mortgaged family home, the only home she and her brother have known since 1997. She tried to get a modification on the mortgage but the mortgage servicer wouldn't even talk to her because she was not on the mortgage. They just wanted her and her brother to walk away from the house. Now the house is in pre-foreclosure and the opportunists are circling like hyenas. She is terrified and doesn't know what to do. Her brother has cerebral palsy, so he cannot use one arm and has difficulty walking, so he can't even help them move out if they can't find a way to save the house. They will lose everything and wind up either living in her little car or sleeping on the streets. I ask nothing within this forum for myself. I only ask for help saving my friend and her brother from losing what little they still have and becoming homeless. Right now the temperatures are over 100 degrees every day where she lives. It is only going to get hotter during the next three months. If they wind up on the streets, they will die. Both have health problems. She has just had three surgeries to remove skin cancer and her brother just had hernia surgery. They have other health challenges, as well. They really need a miracle to happen."

Coin Hunt World is a Pokemon GO like game where you earn crypto for finding keys and opening crates. It also incorporates trivia questions which keeps it exciting. The game is very addicting - and you earn crypto (Bitcoin and ETH) in the process.

Honestly - This game is worth your time. I make about $5 a day for 30 minutes of my time. If you spend more time, you'll make even more.

Sign up today and start earning - [https://coinhunt.gsc.im/LsAMW1Ncdk](https://coinhunt.gsc.im/LsAMW1Ncdk)

The game is very new - Soon all items in-game will be NFT's and you'll be able to make even more revenue. This is a chance to get in early and get some of the rarer items that could be worth quite a bit later on.

Feel free to ask me any questions on Reddit - I'm happy to help answer any questions you may have.

I cannot prove this to be true. Believe it or not is a personal matter for each of you.

But if I wanted to beg, I would have come up with something more compassionate. In this case, I am presenting the truth as it is. Now I am desperate and I want to help her.

I grew up in a small town and just had alot of darkness in my life. Was forced to go to church so i didnt think much of god. That kind of, believe or be beaten worta thing. Went through more hardship when i lost my mom in a car accident i was 14. I felt comfort somehow but still didnt recognize god. Later on in life was homeless on and off until i was 23. During that time, i had an experience. I fooled with drugs like pills and stuff like lsd and shrooms. I was with a girl and slowly fell into madness with my trust issues. I fell into a state of half asleep. I stopped a guy outside a church after not sleeping for like 3 days, losing my job, getting dumped. And he opened his soul and told me he was going through a divorce and all that, without even knowing me. I tried to stand out back of the church and tried to just like listen. A couple guys approached me and asked what i was doing. I said i wanted to listen and learn. They told me a sermon was happening and that i should come back later....thats when i started to figure out my truth. The really weird experience happened right after that and i started to recognize evil....if you want to know that part just ask...

Now I have a family and a small apartment, making ends meet. I want to establish a temple that accepts everyone...no one should be denied their truth. From Judaism to Satanism. Everyone has something to share that has helped them and could help others.

Hi!
I am Kanra (alias). A boy from Iran. Here in my country, the exchange rates for euro is:
1‚Ç¨ = 320000 IRR

I am just starting my high school and I got an offer for studying abroad. The tuition fees will be paid for me, but for other (my visa, ticket, accomodations, etc.) I need approximately 6000‚Ç¨. Due to the exchange rates, I can only make 200‚Ç¨ of it by trying my best and the deadline is for the 25th of September. 

At this point, I am just starting to feel depressed and don't know what to do. High-schools in my region aren't even normal and I know I won't reach any of my goals here. So... I tried the last chance I had. Started this conversation to get recommendations/helps from you.

I can do some photoshop, English to Persian translation and teaching Persian if you want to pay fot that.

Also, I will attach my doge coin address to this post (Iran is under the sanctions of USA so I can't get direct money) and I hope someone would help me. 
This isn't a scam, I really don't know if I can payback anyone's help or not, so I don't promise but I'll try to.
Thanks for reading this, hope y'all a great future.

0.093,0.793,0.114,0.8685,"We know recently bitcoin is struggling and the market is in an extreme fear situation, but Dogecoin seems going strong this few days.

Dogecoin has finally breakthrough down trendline, now we been challenged by resistance around 0.38 - 0.42. Dogecoin will pump much higher if we can break through this resistance.

NOW LOOK CAREFULLY, ALL OF US ARE SAYING DOGECOIN GONNA REACH 1$ AND CRASH, BUT THE ANSWER HERE.

Hourly graph, if you resize the bar pattern from April to May and compare it to the recent price action, you can see ITS VERY SIMILIAR, the bar pattern is almost the same. I also discovered when a cup pattern appeared, once we break through the top our price will not just double up. Go on have a look for yourself you will be shocked as me.

WHAT THIS MEAN!?  DOGECOIN HAS NO LIMIT, NOW IT IS FORMING A TEACUP AND WE ARE AT THE BOTTOM NOW.  IT DOESN'T MATTER WE CRASH 50% BY TODAY JUST LIKE THE OTHER DAY. BUT WHEN THE TEACUP IS FORMED, DOGECOIN WILL NOT JUST HIT 1$. Still, only if Bitcoin can hold and the market is bullish.

I'm so excited to share with all of you and sending a message we are landing much higher than the moon. I'm new to crypto too and I discovered this pattern when I was trying to study dogecoin, so hold your doge we are going places. Plus, lots of you may have known, although when dogecoin is pumping the price could be 50% a day the price action is always in a big waveform, which means big pump and big dump, so no leverage or high multipliers future is recommended.

&#x200B;

Lastly, if you think this is informative or just interesting that you learned something you don't know, I'm happy to be here.

I don't own many dogecoins and I bought a little every day with my extra money, so some dogecoin reward is appreciated.

I normally would not ask things like this but recently I found out a friend of the church had their house burn down about 6 months ago.... and I give my money to other things already and now I feel bad I can't help because I did not plan or know about this, so I think it can't hurt to ask.

From my understanding, he was living out-of-state when this happened and has now moved back because of this. I am unsure specifically of his financial situation beyond this, but the fire was really bad, and destroyed everything, so I think it can't be a great situation, especially if he had to move back closer to what was home before.

If anyone donates it will go directly to the church. The church already has a small fund to help other people in need (Wednesday night donations), but I don't think even the full amount they have in that fund would help much in his situation, and it seems he has been humble through all this and hasn't asked for much, but he is obviously in some need because this was fairly recent when his house burned and no one recovers that quickly.

I give to the church and to others who do the charity work (and I bought Doge also), so I am not wasting money on buying anything myself except holding my Doge. I actually only found out about it because I searched online to make sure I was spelling his name correctly and that's how I found out about it.

I have almost one month before he would come to the church to preach so if anyone would be willing to help, it is more than appreciated and would help surprise someone trying to do God's work. Hopefully there is no hate coming from this, but my goal is I would like to be able to give my pastor some funds to give this other pastor when he visits.

I'd honestly rather not accept Doge because I'd feel horrible selling it to give the church US dollars lol, so I am open even to suggestions of ideas to help as well, because I feel it may crush my soul to do such a thing and is really the only contradiction or bad feeling I feel (to sell the Doge). So hopefully others do not feel bad about me asking such a thing. Any guidance and help of any kind is very much appreciated.

Also please if you are poor, do not give. I feel poorer people like to help, but I also see how the church starts at home... so if you need the money yourself or are poorer than most, please use this money wisely for yourself and your families instead.

I have given Doge address above for my paper-wallet where I held my Doge before transferring off to Coinbase.. again I'd rather take some other form rather than Doge, but if you need another way to donate, it should be easy for me to create another wallet for that coin (or can accept on Coinbase if the coin is there).

Thank you so much for reading.

DDnGJ23YqEcza3uVbDkg2GowBjoUJRkTRy

I'm trying to pay this kindness forward but I need your help.

A friend's spouse, age 65, traveled to Tavira Portugal. At some point her 2 sons could not reach her on the phone, skype or Facebook video. The 2 sons were quite a bit worried after not being able to reach their mother, so their father tried to reach out with no luck. The father and mother are divorced, but amicable and still try to help each other where they can or need.

After no success, they contacted me to help find her. With many phone calls and language translation, I found her at a public hospital in Faro Portugal. She was transported via ambulance to a public hospital, which is free, only for them to release her. She kept falling to the floor with no use of her legs. She would use her arms to pull herself to use her phone to call the ambulance. She had gone through this 3 times only to be released each time with little to no use of her legs. It turns out she has something called Edema.

Right before the last time the hospital released her, a social worker spoke with her and discussed a rehabilitation plan for her to regain use of her legs again. She does not have European health insurance, so her rehabilitation is not free, it is quite expensive.

She was sent to a senior rehabilitation center. The senior rehabilitation center estimated it would take a minimum of two months for her to regain full use of her legs again. She scraped up what little bit she could to pay for some of her stay, but was not enough for full rehabilitation. The father of the two sons let's paycheck-to-paycheck so he's scraped up what he could to help but he does not have enough to pay for the full rehabilitation.

Her rehabilitation costs approximately per month ‚Ç¨1400, which is about $1650 US. 

I have managed to donate some Doge, which is not a lot at this point, but it's a start. 

Any amount will help even if it's just one Dogecoin.

Thank you for your kindness."
